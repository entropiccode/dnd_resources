BAROVIA NOTES:
* Key Players:
- Count Strahd
- Anders Blackwell (The Cleric)
- The Addams Family

The group wakes, with Rain having recovered from whatever was ailing her.  Frost and Cloud are with the group for the initial activities, as Frost was helping to take care of Rain.

Dashaar wakes to find a large package at the end of his bed, with a small note reading:

"Missing you, hope you are enjoying the success you set out to find.  Love always, Mom"

Package contents:
- Staff of Birdcalls
- Orb of Gonging
- Adamantine Breastplate

They all find their way down to the mealhall for breakfast, where they see both Thunder and Kichiro sitting with a familiar looking gnome.  Thunder and Kichiro look very tired, but happy.

As they sit down, Thunder greets them and congratulates the group on their success thus far, and formally introduces the third founder of the Slayer's Guild, Nissa Aelnor, Cleric of Ioun.

Nissa takes over the conversation at this point, formally closing the group's first job - the troll hunt.  She pushes a bag of coin towards the group as well as 3 red/pink potions.  The client was extremely happy with the conditions of the troll hearts, and has provided the 3 potions as an additional reward.
- Coin bag: 500 platinum
- Potions: Potions of Regeneration

Nissa then turns the topic to the werewolf mission.  She states that she followed up on the requestor for that job and was able to determine that the provided name was a false name and contact information had been fabricated.  However, through her contacts she was able to determine the requestor was associated with the city of Thay, a theocracy known for their worship of necromancy.  Nissa slides a small chest of coin across the table and clarifies that all payment is to be made up front to an escrow associated with the guild for situations such as this, and as such the group is still to be paid.
- Coin chest: 1000 platinum.

With this cleared up, Nissa says that she wants the group to handle another job that she is unsure of.  The client and the request are both on another plane of existance, which is the first flag.  The second is the name of the target - Count Strahd von Zarovitch.  The name sounds familiar to the group, although none of htem can place why.  Thunder will chime in asking "Wait, that vacation guy?"

Nissa produces a familiar letter, which reads as follows:

"Are you tired of skulking through the shadows, fighting for your very lives in an unfair world?  Come to Hotel Barovia, and enjoy a getaway in a monster-safe haven, custom tailored to your needs and desires!  Cheap rates and very forgiving payment plans!  Reserve your stay at Hotel Barovia today! - Count Strahd von Zarovitch"

Nissa states that these letters are a frequent appearance for those of a so-called "savage race", a term she says with some derision.  Kichiro clarifies that the term is typically used by racist humans or elves, referring to any non-human, elf, dwarf, halfling or gnome race.  It's unclear why the letters are appearing like this, but they are mostly treated as a joke as the letters never actually detail how to follow through with any reservation requests, or indeed how to get to the hotel.

Given the nature of the prior request and the unusual target, Nissa wants the group to investigate before the guild undertakes the job.
