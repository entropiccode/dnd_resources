BAROVIA NOTES:
* Key Players:
- Count Strahd
- Anders Blackwell (The Cleric)
- The Addams Family

The group wakes, with Rain having recovered from whatever was ailing her.  Frost and Cloud are with the group for the initial activities, as Frost was helping to take care of Rain.

Dashaar wakes to find a large package at the end of his bed, with a small note reading:

"Missing you, hope you are enjoying the success you set out to find.  Love always, Mom"

Package contents:
- Orb of Gonging
- Adamantine Breastplate

They all find their way down to the mealhall for breakfast, where they see both Thunder and Kichiro sitting with a familiar looking gnome.  Thunder and Kichiro look very tired, but happy.

As they sit down, Thunder greets them and congratulates the group on their success thus far, and formally introduces the third founder of the Slayer's Guild, Nissa Aelnor, Cleric of Ioun.

Nissa takes over the conversation at this point, formally closing the group's first job - the troll hunt.  She pushes a bag of coin towards the group as well as 3 red/pink potions.
- Coin bag: 500 platinum
- Potions: Potions of Regeneration

Nissa then turns the topic to the werewolf mission.  She states that she followed up on the requestor for that job and was able to determine that the provided name was a false name and contact information had been fabricated.  However, through her contacts she was able to determine the requestor was associated with the city of Thay, a theocracy known for their worship of necromancy.  Nissa slides a small chest of coin across the table and clarifies that all payment is to be made up front to an escrow associated with the guild for situations such as this, and as such the group is still to be paid.
- Coin chest: 1000 platinum.
