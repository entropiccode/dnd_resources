#### Armor of Thorns
> *Armor (light or medium), uncommon*  
> This armor is decorated with small, metal spikes.  While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal 2d4 force damage to them, as magical purple spikes pulse out from the metal ones.

#### Armor of Undead Fortitude
> *Armor (medium or heavy, not hide) uncommon (requires attunement)*  
> If damage reduces you to 0 hit points while wearing this armor, you can make a Constitution saving throw, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit.  The DC for this saving throw equals 5 + the damage taken.  On a successful save, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

#### Barricade Shield
> *Armor (shield), uncommon*  
> While holding this heavy iron shield, you can use an action to plant it in the ground and expand its height and width to stretch up to 15 feet across in either direction, potentially becoming a flat defensive wall or similar platform. The edges of the shield magically conform to fit the shape of an enclosed space, such as the walls of a tunnel or hallway. While holding the expanded shield in place, your speed becomes 0 and you have disadvantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws. Regardless of the shield's size, its weight remains the same.  
> The expanded shield is considered a nonmagical structure that has AC 14 and 40 hit points. The shield can remain expanded for up to 1 minute before it reverts back to its normal size. The expanded shield reverts early (but is not destroyed) if it reaches 0 hit points or moves. If you're holding the expanded shield, you can choose to revert it early as a bonus action.  
> Once this property of the shield has been used, it can't be used again until the following dawn. 

#### Battlechef Buckler
> *Armor (shield), uncommon*  
> This small shield is the repurposed pot lid of a famous adventuring chef. While wielding the shield, you have advantage on saving throws to resist or avoid taking fire damage.

#### Ironleaf Oaken Shield
> *Armor (shield), uncommon (requires attunement by a druid)*  
> This reinforced wooden shield is covered with ironleaf vines that grant you extra protection.  You gain a +1 bonus to your AC while wielding this shield in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.  In addition, the wooden shield reforms itself to fit you whenever you use your wild shape class feature to transform into a beast.  When you do, the ironleaf vines and wooden shield latch onto your bestial form, granting you a +1 bonus to your AC while transformed in this way.

#### Couatl Herald's Guard
> *Armor (shield), uncommon (requires attunement by a creature of good alignment)*  
> This magic shield is made from yew and covered in durable couatl feathers. When a creature you can see within 10 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to magically take that damage, instead of the creature taking it. When you do so, the damage type changes to force. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until you complete a short or long rest.  
> Flight of the Couatls. While you're attuned to 3 items with this feature, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet. If you already have a flying speed, this speed is in addition to your existing flying speed.

#### Frostbitten Buckler
> *Armor (shield), uncommon*  
> This icy shield has 3 charges and regains all of them each day at dawn. When a creature you can see hits you with a melee attack, you can expend 1 of the shield’s charges as a reaction to deal 2d4 cold damage to the attacking creature. After the attack, you gain that same amount of cold damage as temporary hit points that last for up to 1 minute.

#### Overshield
> *Armor (shield), uncommon (requires attunement)*  
> While holding this large shield, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. The bonus becomes +2 while you have at least 1 temporary hit point. While you have temporary hit points, the shield emits a slight blue glow.  
> In addition, you can channel the heroic resolve within the shield using an action to gain 1d6+8 temporary hit points. Once you've used this ability, you can't use it again until the following dawn.

#### Relentless Bulwark
> *Armor (shield), uncommon (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)*  
> This hefty metal shield is virtually impenetrable. The shield has 6 charges and regains 1d4+2 expended charges each day at dawn. While holding the shield, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 charge to cast shield of faith. When you would fail a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a shield of faith spell cast using the shield, you can use your reaction to expend another charge to succeed on the saving throw instead. You can only use this reaction in this way while holding the shield.

#### Retaliating Shield of Ink
> *Armor (shield), uncommon*  
> This shield has a hidden compartment inside that can spray thick squid ink at attacking creatures. When a Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of you misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to press a button on the shield’s handle. When you do, ink sprays from the front of the shield at the face of the attacking creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the beginning of its next turn.  
> The shield can hold up to 3 uses of the ink before needing to be refilled. It takes 1 minute to refill the shield using a vial of squid ink worth at least 20gp. Alternatively, you can use a vial of thinner writing ink worth 5gp. If you do. the save DC becomes 10 instead.  
> This is a mechanical item whose purpose and functionality can be understood following a successful Intelligence check (DC 12). On a success, you can interpret what the shield does, how to use it, and how to take care of it. You also understand that filling the shield with other volatile or sticky liquids such as acid, poison, grog, oil, or any other solid material such as sand, will damage the machinery inside and take 8 hours of work to repair.
