You gain a +1 bonus to your AC while wielding this shield in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.  
> While wielding the shield, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause it to shatter into countless fragments of pure light.

The light surrounds you for 1 minute, until you dismiss the effect as a bonus action, or until you fall unconscious or die, at which point the shield rematerializes on the ground at your feet or into your hand if you have one free. If your holy symbol is emblazoned or attached to the shield, it floats prominently amidst the shards of light and continues to function as a spellcasting focus. Undead creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls made against you while you're surrounded by the light in this way.

#### Dragon Turtle Shield
> *Armor (shield), rare*  
> This magical shield is made from a piece of reclaimed dragon turtle shell. The brass dragon turtle head sculpture adorning its front magically creates and heats a small reservoir of water that replenishes each day at dawn. When you take fire damage, you can use your reaction to speak the shield's command word to superheat the water inside and halve the fire damage you take from the attack, effect, or spell that triggered it. The superheated water is released as dense cloud of steam centered on a point adjacent to you, heavily obscuring the area in a 20-foot radius sphere that spreads around corners. The cloud does not move with you and lasts for 1 minute or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

Alternatively, you can expend 1 charge as an action to attempt to gain control of a water vehicle you can see within 300 feet of you that has a rudder. When you do, if that water vehicle has a creature currently controlling its direction, you can make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the other creature's Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, you wrestle control away from the creature and can alter the direction of the water vehicle by up to 90 degrees. A creature can use its action to regain control of the water vehicle by succeeding on a Strength (Athletics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check. If there is no creature currently controlling the direction of the water vehicle you chose, you automatically succeed on the ability check.

#### Retaliating Bloom Shield
> *Armor (shield), rare*  
> This steel shield hides a slim chamber in its center where magical flora grow and release their toxic pollen.  The chamber is covered using an intricate, interlocking series of metal plates and flaps that, once released, resembles a flower.  
> When a Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of you misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to block the attack with your shield and  use the impact to release the chamber's mechanism: exposing and releasing the flowers' pollen in the face of the attacking creature.  That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 3d10 poison damage and be poisoned for 1 minute.  On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn't poisoned.  Once the pollen has been released in this way, this property of the shield can't be used again until the following dusk when the flowers release another wave of pollen.
