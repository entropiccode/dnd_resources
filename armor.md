#### Dragon Turtle Shield
> *Armor (shield), rare*  
> This magical shield is made from a piece of reclaimed dragon turtle shell. The brass dragon turtle head sculpture adorning its front magically creates and heats a small reservoir of water that replenishes each day at dawn. When you take fire damage, you can use your reaction to speak the shield's command word to superheat the water inside and halve the fire damage you take from the attack, effect, or spell that triggered it. The superheated water is released as dense cloud of steam centered on a point adjacent to you, heavily obscuring the area in a 20-foot radius sphere that spreads around corners. The cloud does not move with you and lasts for 1 minute or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

> When a Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of you misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to block the attack with your shield and  use the impact to release the chamber's mechanism: exposing and releasing the flowers' pollen in the face of the attacking creature.  That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 3d10 poison damage and be poisoned for 1 minute.  On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn't poisoned.  Once the pollen has been released in this way, this property of the shield can't be used again until the following dusk when the flowers release another wave of pollen.

> The shield has 8 charges and regains 1d6 + 2 expended charges each day at dawn.
