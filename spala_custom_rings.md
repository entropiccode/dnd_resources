# Ring

> **Apprentice Ring of Distance**
> *Ring, common*
> A simple silver ring etched with swirling patterns used by apprentice level spellcasters.  When worn, the ring doubles the casting range of ranged, offensive cantrips you cast.

> **Pair of Tiny Violin Rings**
> *Ring, common*
> This set of twin rings plays a sad, sad melody when you rub the two fingers wearing them together. Creatures that know the "vicious mockery" cantrip can use this set of rings as a somatic component instead of the required vocal component of the spell.

> **Arcane Ring**
> *Ring, rare (requires attunement)*
> This ring has 3 charges, and regains 1d4 charges after a long rest.  While casting a spell, you can expend one charge to use one of the following meta magic options: careful spell, distant spell, empowered spell, or extended spell.  
> In addition, an action and two charges lets you cast arcane eye through the ring.

> **Ring of Keys**
> *Ring, rare*
> This plain, unassuming gold ring comes with 3 charges.  You can allows its wearer to cast knock once per day.

> **Signet of Elemental Warding**
> *Ring, rare (requires attunement)*
> This ring comes with 3 charges.  A silver band bearing a symbol representing the element the ring protects from.  The possible elements are acid, cold, fire, lightning or thunder.  As a reaction to taking damage from the element matching the attuned ring, or to an ally within 15 feet taking damage from the element matching the attuned ring, you can use 1 or more charges and reduce matching elemental damage taken by 2d10 per charge used (for example, a Signet of Fire Warding can reduce fire damage by 2d10 per charge).  The ring regains 1d4-1 charges after a short rest.  If the ring is reduced to 0 charges, roll a d20.  On a roll of 1, the ring loses its magical power and becomes a normal silver ring worth 10 gp.

> **Hemoturge's Enervating Band**
> *Ring, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*
> This dark grey iron band has two gems embedded on opposite sides, both blood red rubies. You can use an action to concentrate on the rubies. You take necrotic damage equal to your level to regain expended spell slots that have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. This damage cannot be reduced or avoided in any way.
