> This heart-shaped necklace has a ruby gem locket on its end. While a creature is wearing this locket, they become made aware if anyone else wearing an identical locket is in deadly danger. For clarification, these are always found or made in a set, and don't work with other lockets not made at the same time as it (at the DM's discretion, there may be some way of connecting different heartache lockets, allowing some expansion to the set). 
> When any creature wearing one of a set of these falls unconscious at 0 hit points or dies (whichever comes first), the ruby of every heartache locket in the set begins to glow a bright red glow that darkens slightly before lighting up again in a pattern of the individual wearer's heartbeat, and also warms up to a noticeable amount. This effect occurs regardless of where the wearers are, even across planes. The gem then emits red bright light in a 5-foot radius from the wearer, and dim light for another 5 feet. The glow and warmth lasts an hour until all necklaces stop glowing, though they are reusable and end early if all wearers recover to at least 1 hit point.

> When the tag is pulled again (hangs on the entrance) the tent retracts back into the small black cube. The rations stored in the tent stays in the tent for later use, and time affects the rations stored as normal. This item can only be used once, and the item regains use of this effect at dawn.

> **Seeker's Compass**  
> *Wondrous item, rare*  
> A compass inside of an otherwise nondescript wooden case. Inside the face of the compass is covered with symbols that resemble constellations. If the bearer holds the compass and concentrates on a person, object, or location for one minute the compass will point in approximately that direction until it is closed again. If the concentration isn't specific enough the compass with either point to something that's close to the idea, or the nearest object that fits the bill (ex. concentrate on "gold" or "piles of gold" without a specific place in mind and the compass will point to the nearest wallet or loose change).

Alternatively, you can choose to have the target make the saving throw with advantage but dealing double damage (halved to normal damage on a successful save).  Once either option of this feature has been used, the feature cannot be used again until you have finished a short rest.

> The lantern has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges each day at dusk. As an action, you can expend a charge by touching it to a Large or smaller corpse within 5 feet of you. When you do, a ghostly blue illusion of the fallen creature appears above its corpse to silently reenact the last 6 seconds of its life. The illusion only shows the creature's actions and reactions, such as reacting to an unseen monster or trying to extinguish the flames of a fiery trap, but does not show the monster or effect causing the actions or reactions. This ability has no effect on undead creatures. Once a corpse's death has been revealed in this way, it cannot be shown again.
> Alternatively, you can expend a charge as an action while holding the lantern aloft and speaking its command word. If there are any undead creatures within 60 feet of you that are not behind total cover, the lantern's light flashes a foreboding red color before returning to its normal blue glow.

> **Wraith's Cloak**  
> *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  
> This black silk cloak covers the wearer in constant shadow.  While attuned to this cloak, you can use your bonus action to step into a shadow within 5 feet of you and reappear in another shadow within 60 feet.  This effect can only be used once per long rest.

> **Superior Rituals.** Arcanum spellbooks are able to assist in the ritual casting process to where it no longer takes 10 minutes to cast a ritual spell.  You now only need 1 minute to ritual cast a spell.
> **Arcane Security.** Arcanum spellbooks are enchanted with the following spells: alarm, arcane lock, illusory script and magic mouth. The alarm only triggers if someone that you do not allow touches or reads your spellbook. The arcane lock is not suppressed with the use of the knock spell.
