#### Permanent Hair Dye

This effect can be reversed with dispel magic or greater restoration.

# Rare

#### Essence of Rage
> *Potion, rare*  
> This bubbling red liquid is always warm and tastes of iron and bitter raisins. You can drink this potion as a bonus action. When you do, you enter a rage that lasts for 1 minute or until you're knocked unconscious. This rage grants you the same effects as a 1st-level barbarian's class feature with the following exception: if you end your turn and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then, you take 1d4 psychic damage and your rage does not end. You can enter this rage even if you're wearing heavy armor.

#### Hawkeye Kohl
> *Potion, uncommon*  
> When applied around the eyes, this black powdery makeup allows the wearer to shoot ranged weapons they are proficient with up to their maximum range without disadvantage for 8 hours or until removed.  
> The user gains advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect movement, so long as the check relies on sight. Hawkeye Kohl is especially valued in sunny regions due to its light absorbing property, which conversely can prove a detriment in poorly lit conditions, taking the form of a 20-foot line of sight penalty in dim light.  
> Creatures with Sunlight Sensitivity do not have disadvantage on sight based checks while wearing Hawkeye Kohl.  
> Hawkeye Kohl is typically found in a small earthen pot with a 1d6 usage die.

On a failed save, the poison takes hold. While the poison is in effect, the creature is blind and unable to sleep. When an affected creature attempts to rest, their dreams are plagued with terrible nightmares and are unable to gain the benefits of a long rest. The creature can reattempt the saving throw after 24 hours have passed.  
> The poison lasts until the affected creature succeeds on a saving throw or is cured by the greater restoration, heal, or wish spell.
