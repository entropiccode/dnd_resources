When the needle-like bolt is used, this crossbow ignores the loading property.
> 
> This weapon has 4 charges, recharging 1d4 each dawn. You can expend a charge following a successful attack with the crossbow to attach the bolt's arcane thread to a point on the ground within 5 feet of the target.

> *Weapon (whip), rare*

> In addition, while attuned to this weapon, you have access to the *eldritch blast*, *mage hand*, and *prestidigitation* cantrips.

> **Dragon-Kindled Edge**
> *Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)*
> This magnificent blade is crafted from the remains of a great Ancient dragon. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with this magic weapon. When you hit a dragon with this weapon, the dragon takes an extra 2d6 damage of the weapon's type. For the purpose of this weapon, "dragon" refers to any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles and wyverns. In addition, while you are attuned to this weapon, you can read and understand draconic.
>
> **Kindled Cleave.** When you are the target of a hostile dragon's breath attack, you can use your reaction to hold the blade in front of you. If you do, the sword cleaves through the breath attack, leaving you and creatures behind you in a 30 foot cone unscathed by the attack. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until the following dawn. If you cleave a breath attack in this way, the blade becomes charged with powerful draconic magic, shedding dim light in a 10 foot radius around the sword the color of the dragon's breath for up to one minute. The next melee weapon attack you land against a creature using this blade while it sheds light deals an additional 6d6 damage of the dragon breath's damage type. This empowered attack cuts through damage resistances, and treats damage immunities as if they were resistances instead.
> 
> **Lesser Draconic Resistance.** If you roll a saving throw and fail by 4 or less, you can choose to succeed on it instead. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until the following dawn.

> The trident has a chain attached to its handle that can be used to retrieve the weapon once it's been thrown using a bonus action. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an additional 1d8 lightning damage.
> 
> In addition, this trident acts as a conduit for the sky's ferocious power. Immediately after hitting a creature with the trident, you can call down a bolt of lightning upon it, forcing it and all creatures within 5 feet to make a DC16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, creatures take 6d10 lightning damage, or half as much on a success. Creatures have disadvantage on the saving throw if they're submerged in water or wearing metal armor. You are immune to the lightning damage caused by this effect. This ability fails if the creatures are obstructed from the sky. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until the next dawn.
>
> **Impale.** You can use your action to try to impale and pull a creature toward you. If your target is a creature that is no more than one size larger than you, you can make a ranged weapon attack against it using the trident. If you hit, you can attempt to pull the impaled creature toward you by making a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) check. If you succeed, you can pull the creature up to 20 feet toward you.

> 
> As an action, you can make a single melee attack against a creature you can see within 120 feet of you.  If the attack hits, Yamato deals force damage instead of slashing damage, and you can use a bonus action to teleport to a space next to the target.  Once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you have taken a long rest.
> 
> If you land a critical hit with Yamato, regardless of the range of your attack, all creatures of your choosing within 5 feet of your target you hit must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, or take the same attack damage as the target of your attack.
>
> If you have damaged a creature with Yamato this turn, you may cast Misty Step at will, without using a spell slot or components.
>
> If you fall below half of your maximum hit points while wielding Yamato, it loses all of its features except for its bonus to attack and damage rolls.  These features will return when your hit points are back over half of your maximum.

> **Pike of the Forgotten Legion**
> *Weapon (pike), legendary (requires attunement)*
> You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  This weapon has 6 charges and regains 1d4+2 expended charges each day at dusk.  While holding the pike, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 16): mirror image (1 charge), phantom steed (1 charge), speak with dead (1 charge), or spirit guardians (2 charges).
>
> **Spectral Warrior.** Once on your turn when you hit a creature with an attack using the pike, you can choose to summon a spectral warrior from the weapon.  Until the start of your next turn, that creature is haunted by the warrior.  That creature has disadvantage on any weapon attack it makes against you until the start of your next turn.  This property has no effect against undead creatures.
> 
> **Haunting Phalanx.** You can use an action while holding the pike to expend 3 charges and point it forward commandingly.  5 spectral, pike-wielding warriors appear before you and march in a 25 by 50-foot line in a direction you choose.  Any creature within that line's area must make a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw.  On a failure, a creature takes 3d10 necrotic and 3d10 psychic damage and are under the effects of the weapon's spectral warriors property.  On a success, the creature takes half damage and isn't affected by the spectral warriors.  Undead creatures automatically succeed on the saving throw.  Once this feature of the pike has been used, it can't be used again until you finish a short or long rest.

> *Wondrous item, rare*
> This heart-shaped necklace has a ruby gem locket on its end. While a creature is wearing this locket, they become made aware if anyone else wearing an identical locket is in deadly danger. For clarification, these are always found or made in a set, and don't work with other lockets not made at the same time as it (at the DM's discretion, there may be some way of connecting different heartache lockets, allowing some expansion to the set). 
> When any creature wearing one of a set of these falls unconscious at 0 hit points or dies (whichever comes first), the ruby of every heartache locket in the set begins to glow a bright red glow that darkens slightly before lighting up again in a pattern of the individual wearer's heartbeat, and also warms up to a noticeable amount. This effect occurs regardless of where the wearers are, even across planes. The gem then emits red bright light in a 5-foot radius from the wearer, and dim light for another 5 feet. The glow and warmth lasts an hour until all necklaces stop glowing, though they are reusable and end early if all wearers recover to at least 1 hit point. Finally, all of the necklaces have the Unbreakable minor property, making it impossible to do something to the wearer that prevents the effect from occurring, except for using a wish to destroy the locket before killing the wearer.

> **Pop-up Tent**
> *Wondrous item, rare*
> This small 3 inch black cube has a tag on it that reads, "Pull me!". When the tag is pulled, it pops out of your hands and lands 5ft in front of you.

> The inside of the tent is huge, it has a kitchen, furniture, 10 beds, a large table for 10, and is well lit with magical lanterns. The tent can be stocked with rations(up to 3 days worth for 10 people). 
> When the tag is pulled again (hangs on the entrance) the tent retracts back into the small black cube. The rations stored in the tent stays in the tent for later use, and time affects the rations stored as normal. This item can only be used once, and the item regains use of this effect at dawn.

> **Seeker's Compass**
> *Wondrous item, rare*
> A compass inside of an otherwise nondescript wooden case. Inside the face of the compass is covered with symbols that resemble constellations. If the bearer holds the compass and concentrates on a person, object, or location for one minute the compass will point in approximately that direction until it is closed again. If the concentration isn't specific enough the compass with either point to something that's close to the idea, or the nearest object that fits the bill (ex. concentrate on "gold" or "piles of gold" without a specific place in mind and the compass will point to the nearest wallet or loose change).  The more specific or well known the subject of concentration is, the more accurately the compass will point. Once a compass has been used in this way, it may not be used again until the next dawn.

If you reduce the lightning damage to 0, before the end of your next turn you can cast shocking grasp with a range of 30 feet.

> **Subtle Lute Strings**

Alternatively, you can choose to have the target make the saving throw with advantage but dealing double damage (halved to normal damage on a successful save).  Once either option of this feature has been used, the feature cannot be used again until you have finished a short rest.

> **True Heart Bangle**
> *Wondrous item, rare*
> A silver and white gold bangle worn on the upper arm, with a heart shaped pink diamond affixed to it.
> The wearer has a +5 bonus and advantage on all insight checks.

> This dark hooded lantern glows with a magical blue flame and can reveal the demise of a creature no longer among the living. The lantern sheds bright, bluish light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. You can use an action to reduce the light's reach or cover it completely.
> The lantern has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges each day at dusk. As an action, you can expend a charge by touching it to a Large or smaller corpse within 5 feet of you. When you do, a ghostly blue illusion of the fallen creature appears above its corpse to silently reenact the last 6 seconds of its life. The illusion only shows the creature's actions and reactions, such as reacting to an unseen monster or trying to extinguish the flames of a fiery trap, but does not show the monster or effect causing the actions or reactions. This ability has no effect on undead creatures. Once a corpse's death has been revealed in this way, it cannot be shown again.
> Alternatively, you can expend a charge as an action while holding the lantern aloft and speaking its command word. If there are any undead creatures within 60 feet of you that are not behind total cover, the lantern's light flashes a foreboding red color before returning to its normal blue glow.

> **Wraith's Cloak**
> *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*
> This black silk cloak covers the wearer in constant shadow.  While attuned to this cloak, you can use your bonus action to step into a shadow within 5 feet of you and reappear in another shadow within 60 feet.  This effect can only be used once per long rest.  If you are also attuned to the Wraith’s Hood, both items only count as a single attunement, and your darkvision increases by 30 feet.

> **Amulet of Potency**
> *Amulet, very rare (requires attunement)*
> While wearing this amulet, your critical range increases by 1.
> Furthermore, when you land a critical hit, you roll all of the attack's damage dice thrice times instead of twice.

> **Arcanum Spellbook**
> *Wondrous item, very rare*
> An arcanum spellbook is a collective source of any and all wizards spells; past, present and future. The spellbook allows wizards to have any spells that they can muster within the tomb expanding their already vast knowledge.
> **Limitless Scrolls.** Within an arcanum spellbook's pages are scrolls that appear to be without end. When copying spells from spell scrolls and the like, the wizard is able to copy these spells into this book by simply placing the scroll into the book as it takes the new scroll and magically sews the item into the books binding. The wizard must still spend the required time practicing any spells copied in this way as described in the wizard class on copying spells into your spellbook.
> **Superior Rituals.** Arcanum spellbooks are able to assist in the ritual casting process to where it no longer takes 10 minutes to cast a ritual spell.  You now only need 1 minute to ritual cast a spell.
> **Arcane Security.** Arcanum spellbooks are enchanted with the following spells: alarm, arcane lock, illusory script and magic mouth. The alarm only triggers if someone that you do not allow touches or reads your spellbook. The arcane lock is not suppressed with the use of the knock spell. The illusory script makes it to where if someone were to read your spellbook it would just be utter nonsense. The magic mouth states a message, within the limits of the spell, of your choice when the book is opened.

> **Boots of Winged Haste**
> *Boots, very rare (requires attunement)*
> While you wear these boots, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed.  You can use the boots to fly for up to 4 hours, all at once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration.  If you are flying when the duration ends, you descent at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.
> In addition, these boots come with 3 charges.  While wearing them, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges and click your heels together to cast the haste spell on yourself.
> The boots regain 2 hours of flying and 1 charge of haste for every 12 hours they aren’t in use.

> **Bracers of the Dawnbringer**
> *Wondrous item, very rare*
> These bronze bracers are ornately decorated with a gold finish, and seem to emit a dull red glow.
> If you are of a good alignment, while wearing these bracers whenever you deal radiant or fire damage, as a bonus action, you can make the attack deal 1d8 additional fire or radiant damage.
> Whenever you kill a creature with radiant or fire damage, the flames cover the creature and almost seem to expand. Any creature within 5 feet of the creature that you killed takes 2d6 fire or radiant damage.
> All fire and radiant damage you take is reduced by 3.

> **Blingtron**
> *Wondrous item, legendary*
> Over the course of a short or long rest, you can set Blingtron down on the ground and greet it.  Doing so will cause it to power on and greet you in return, handing you a small gift pulled from an unseen compartment.  Blingtron remains active for the duration of the rest, and any one who comes up and greets it during that time will also be given a small gift.  Blingtron will only give one gift per person during a rest.  At the end of the rest, Blingtron powers down and folds back up for storage and travel.  Once he has powered down,  Blingtron cannot be activated again for 24 hours.
> The small gift contains 3 presents.  Roll d100 to determine the first present, and the second and third presents are always Worthless Junk worth 1d6 gp.  Refer to the table below to determine what the present is.
> | d100 | Result |
