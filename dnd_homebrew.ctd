					<rich_text>*Wondrous item, Artifact (requires attunement by a sorcerer in tune to wild magic)*

Bangles made from interwoven vines of gilded metal seemingly not of this world, catching the light in pleasing ways no matter the situation.  To most, these are well made but mundane bracers, as they do not respond to normal magic, not even registering to a detect magic spell.  When attuned to one with an unusual connection to the weave, they reveal their power.

**Channeled Chaos.** While attuned to these bracelets, you can channel the unpredictable properties of your weave into the spells you cast, instead of building up energy into an inevitable surge. When you cast a spell that deals damage that is not bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage, you can choose to forego gaining surge charges and roll 1d10. The damage the spell deals changes to the type listed in the Random Element Table. You cannot utilize this feature while storing a surge as per the **Surge Storage** feature of this item.

**Strange Shift.** If **Stranger Things** is active while you are wearing these bracers, you may roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns.  On a roll of 15 or higher, you shift into the Astral Plane. You remain there until the start of your next turn, at which time you can return to the spot where you were, or a spot to 5 feet away from where you were.  If the spot where you were is occupied, you return to a spot 5 feet away of your choosing.

**Surge Storage.** If you would trigger a Wild Magic Surge while attuned to these bangles, you may choose to store the surge within the bangles instead of rolling on the Wild Magic Surge table.  While the bangles are storing a surge in this way, the spaces between the filigree emits a soft blue/violet glow. You can choose to release the energy stored within and roll on the Wild Magic Surge table at any time you could normally trigger a Wild Magic surge, even if you have already triggered a different Wild Magic Surge. The bangles can only hold the energy of a single surge in this way, and a surge can only be held for up to 1 minute, after which time the energy is automatically released and you must roll on the Wild Magic Surge table. While you are storing a surge within the bangles, you cannot benefit from the **Channeled Chaos** feature of these bangles.

Bangles made from interwoven vines of gilded metal seemingly not of this world, catching the light in pleasing ways no matter the situation.

When attuned to one with an unusual connection to the weave, they reveal their power.

When you cast a spell that deals damage that is not bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage, you can choose to forego gaining surge charges and roll 1d10.

You remain there until the start of your next turn, at which time you can return to the spot where you were, or a spot to 5 feet away from where you were.  If the spot where you were is occupied, you return to a spot 5 feet away of your choosing.

You have greater control over when Wild Magic Surges happen.  If you would trigger a Wild Magic Surge, you can use your reaction and roll a 1d4.  The surge does not trigger, instead you can hold the surge for up to a number of turns equal to the number rolled, releasing it at any time you choose until that point.  If you do not release the surge during this time, it is automatically released at the beginning of your turn after a number of your turns equal to the number you rolled has passed (for example, if you roll a 2, you can hold your surge for up to 2 turns.  If you do not release your surge on either of those turns, it automatically releases at the start of the third turn after you held the surge). If you trigger a Wild Magic Surge while you are already holding a surge, you will no longer be able to maintain your hold on the stored surge, and both will trigger at the same time.

The Immortal Codex
Starting at 1st level, the Curious has blessed you with the Immortal Codex, its infinite pages overflowing with timeless knowledge.  You now prepare spells as a Wizard does, instead of having learned spells as Warlocks traditionally do.  You prepare the list of spells that are available for you to cast by choosing a number of spells from your Immortal Codex equal to the number of spells you would otherwise know at your current level.  The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.  Preparing a new list of spells requires time spent studying your Immortal Codex and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

You may inscribe spells from both Warlock and Wizard Spell Lists into the Immortal Codex, and when your Spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace a Warlock spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the Warlock or Wizard spell list.  All spells inscribed into the Immortal Codex are Warlock spells for you.

If you later take the Pact of the Tome, the Immortal Codex is your Book of Shadows, and you gain the ability to summon and dismiss the tome from a pocket dimension as a bonus action.  
If you take the Ritual Caster feat, the Immortal Codex serves as the Ritual Book the feat requires.

Arcane Aptitude
Starting at 1st level, the Curious has blessed you with a portion of their power, and with it an affinity for the arcane.  You gain proficiency with the Arcana skill, and you gain two cantrips of your choice from the Wizard spell list.  Cantrips granted by this feature count as Warlock spells for you.  You learn one additional cantrip from the Wizard spell list at 6th level, and again at 10th and 14th level.

Iterative Testing
As you hit 6th level, you've learned to apply the weapon that is your mind more appropriately in combat.  If you make a spell attack with a cantrip and miss, then use your next available action to make another spell attack with the same cantrip against the same target resulting in a hit, you may roll an additional damage die of the same type used by the cantrip itself.

In addition, when making a spell attack with a cantrip, you may add half of your Charisma modifier (rounded down) to the attack roll, and when dealing damage with a cantrip, you may add your full Charisma modifier to the damage roll.

Learned Eternity
At 10th level, your patron widens your mental horizons.  You gain proficiency in two of the following: History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, or Religion.  Alternatively, you may gain proficiency in two tools of your choosing, or a combination of a skill from the prior list and a tool.

You may then choose one of your skill or tool proficiencies.  You gain expertise in the chosen skill or tool and Arcana.

You also inscribe 4 spells of your choosing from any spell list into the Immortal Codex.  A spell you choose must be of a level for which you have spell slots.  These spells do not count against spells known, and count as Warlock spells for you.

Pseudo-prescience
Starting at 14th level, as an action, you can give yourself the benefits of the foresight spell for one minute.  Additionally, while this feature is active, you can spend a bonus action to give a creature that can hear you within 30 feet the benefits of the spell until the start of your next turn.
	
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
	
Custom Invocations
At 2nd level, a warlock gains the Eldritch Invocations feature.  Here are new options for that feature, in addition to the options in the Player's Handbook, that are designed for the Arcanist patron.

If an eldritch invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn the invocation.  You can learn the invocation at the same time you meet its prerequisite.  A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

				<rich_text>The Fey folk, the good people, the little people.  From fairy glamour to illusions and trickery, the fey are known for their special magic.  Knowledge of their magic is very rare, for they do not share it freely.  Those who study this magic gain access to strange and weird experiences with magic, some even claim to realize reality as being like a dream.

2nd-Level Ribbon Feature
At 2nd level, your unique method of training allows you to far more rapidly adjust the spells you are capable of wielding than most.  You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a short rest or long rest.

You've also learned the benefits of scribing even lesser spells into your spellbook.  When changing your list of prepared spells, you may also change a cantrip you currently know, and replace it with another cantrip from the Wizard Spell List.
 
2nd-Level Feature
Starting at 2nd level, when you cause a creature to make a saving throw against an enchantment or illusion spell you cast for the first time in combat, that creature makes their saving throw with disadvantage.  This feature's effect is unique per creature.

Mentalis Obscura
At 6th level, you can erase yourself from a creature's sight momentarily.  As a bonus action, choose a creature within 60 feet of you.  That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC.  If the creature is currently enchanted by you, or under the effects of an illusion you have cast, they make this saving throw at disadvantage.  On a failed save, you become invisible to the creature for 1 minute, or until you affect it with a spell or attack.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest

### OPTION 1
Mark of the Elders
Starting at 10th level, if a creature fails the initial saving throw against an Enchantment or Illusion spell you cast, you may choose for the spell to not take effect (the spell slot and any necessary materials are still consumed), and your target gains the Mark of the Elders.  If your spell targets multiple creatures, you may choose a single creature to be the recipient of the mark.  This mark is invisible, and can only be seen by you, or creatures with truesight.  The target is mystically unaware they have the mark unless they can see it, disbelieving others who may try to inform them of it.  The Mark of the Elders will remain on your target for 24 hours, or until you are more than 100 miles away from your target.

Once a creature bears the Mark of the Elders for 8 hours, the mark becomes primed.  You are immediately aware when a mark has become primed, and at any point following this, you may choose to detonate the mark.  When the mark detonates, the spell you chose to consume when afflicting the mark is then cast at a level higher than you originally cast it (max 6th level), originating on the target of the mark.  If the spell does not normally target an area, it targets an area in a 20 foot radius sphere instead of targetting individual creatures.

Only one creature can be affected by the Mark of the Elders at a time, and once you have detonated the mark, you cannot affect another creature with the Mark of the Elders until you have finished a long rest.

### OPTION 2
Mark that links creatures together, for good (healing, increased speed moving towards each other, etc), or bad (explosions)

14th-Level Feature
Starting at 14th level, you have gained mastery over the finer points of residual magics.  When you or an ally within 30 feet of you are under the effect of a spell or effect that requires a save at the end of a round to end you can use your reaction to end the effect on the target as though the duration had already passed.  Additionally, when an enemy is under the effects of one of your spells that requires a saving throw at the end of the round you can use your reaction to cause them to fail the save as though it had never happened.

You may use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier and regain all expended uses on a long rest.

You have learned to imbue your magic with an abrasive nature that, over time, can erode away even the strongest resistance

When you gain this feat, choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. When you cast a spell that deals your chosen damage type they have an additional effect. After dealing damage (or attempting to if creature has Absorption or Immunity), the target loses a level of resistance to your damage of that type

The effect can stack multiple times, reducing resistance further, however at the end of their turn targets make a constitution saving throw. On a success they remove a stack and lower the total reduction to the appropriate level 

Absorption is treated as immunity, Immunity as resistance, Resistance is ignored, Normal and vulnerable creatures take an additional 1d6 of damage per stack

This item appears as a small oblong piece of metal or stone a few inches long. The item itself is very gently drawn to a specific location, which varies from one dowsing stone to another. The pulling force just enough that a creature who holds it can faintly feel the tug. If set on natural ground, the pull will not be enough for the stone to roll through dirt, sand, or clumps of grass even if the stone is perfectly round.

Dowsing stones are occasionally sold for well-known locations in lieu of, or in addition to, traditional maps and directions. Often these stones are colored or painted with specific colors or patterns that correlate to their targeted location, such as a stone painted with wheat that is drawn towards a farming village known for that crop. Stones tied to elusive or obscure locations may be of greater rarity and value.

This glass and silver goblet is enchanted with a harmless, strange magic.  A liquid poured in the cup bends gravity in comical ways, often to surprise and endrenchment of an unexpected drinker.  When the cup is tilted, as if to drink, the liquid flows in the opposite direction of gravity--sliding up the cup instead of down it.  Once the liquid reaches the edge of the cup, it immediately pours down as normal.  Swirling the liquid causes it  to flow in the opposite direction in which it's rotated.  Anything solid other than ice that's floating in the liquid is not affected by the cup's magic.</rich_text>

This woven band can be worn as a necklace or bracelet by resizing the strap. While attuned to and wearing the band, you can use an action to summon a spectral companion that appears in a space within 5 feet of you. The companion can be a dog, cat, bird, or similar Small or smaller beast. The form is translucent and immaterial, but feels warm to the touch. It emits dim light in a 5 foot radius. The companion remains until dismissed (no action required) or until you remove the band. It is not considered to be a creature, does not occupy a space, and does not require food, water, or air. It is friendly towards you and other creatures of your choice and stays within 30 feet of you at all times, moving through objects as necessary in order to do so. The companion wears a spectral copy of the band on its neck or leg when you summon it (your choice). The companion understands the emotion and intent of your commands, but cannot speak. Attempting to target the companion with a ”detect thoughts” spell only reveals an overwhelming sense of love and affection towards you.

Once the same spectral companion has remained or has been summoned at least once a day for 7 consecutive days, the band becomes attuned to you instead. When it does, the band no longer requires you to attune to it in order to use the item, and no creature other than you can use its magic without first attuning to it themselves. When another creature attunes to the band in this way, its connection to you is broken. Once the band is attuned to you in this way, you can summon the companion using a bonus action instead of an action, but can no longer change its form when summoning it. In addition, once the band is attuned to you, the companion becomes partially physical, allowing you and creatures of your choice to gently pet and hold its otherwise spectral form.</rich_text>

The Dusty Ring can be activated using an action to summon a dust mephit. The dust mephit will speak all languages as the summoner, and be of the same alignment, too. The mephit has a deep respect and admiration for the summoner, and is indefinably loyal, but is not considered charmed by the summoner and will disobey the summoner's orders if it believes it to be in the summoner's best interest.

The mephit has a strange obsession with eating dirt and will constantly want to seek out new and exciting dirts to eat. The mephit's admiration for its summoner grows the filthier the summoner is, showering the summoner with praise and compliments, and will express profound disappointment every time the summoner bathes. If the mephit is destroyed or when you are able to summon a new one, the ring re-summons the same one.

The ring regains use of this effect at dawn.

This whip is made using the shrunken tentacle of a great sea creature. It still moves slightly on its own.

As an action, you may try to wrap a Medium or smaller creature within the weapon's range using the whip's tentacle. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 14) or become constricted by the tentacle, dealing 1d4+2 bludgeoning damage immediately after failing the saving throw and again at the end of each of its subsequent turns while gripped by the tentacle. The creature may reattempt the saving throw as an action each turn to try and escape the tentacle again. While holding a creature in this way, you cannot make attacks with the whip. You may end this affect at any time (no action required).

While constricted, a creature cannot move or be more than 10' away from you in any direction, and your speed is halved. If you drop the whip while a creature is gripped by the tentacle, both your and the creature's movement returns to normal, although the tentacle will continue to hold and damage the creature until it breaks free.

This miniscule, mechanical beetle is 1 inch long and quietly whirs with a mix of magical and mechanical forces.  Placing the beetle on a piece of parchment you hold or carry causes it to spring to life and begin tracking your travels.  As you move, so does the beetle.  It leaves behind a small line of ink that it generates.  The ink immediately dries and doesn't dissolve in water.  In addition, the beetle's small frame allows it to move even while enclosed in a book or similar enclosure without losing its sense of movement or direction.

The beetle has a dial on its underside.  A creature can use the dial to select the scale in which the beetle moves.  For each option, the beetle moves 1 inch in teh same direction as you for every amount you move as shown on the dial, creating a map of your journey: 20 feet, 200 feet, 2 miles, or 20 miles.  The beetle is immune to magical effects that would otherwise alter its sense of direction.

The beetle always knows which direction is North.  When placed on a piece of parchment for the first time, it crouches down to stamp a small compass rose on the sheet before beginning to move.  If the beetle runs out of space on the parchment to travel, it stops moving in that direction and emits a clicking sound that can be heard by creatures within 5 feet of it.

Attaching one </rich_text>
						<rich_text style="italic">band of the lost and found</rich_text>

These gauntlets come with 3 charges, which recharge after a long rest once all have been used.  On a successful hit with a melee weapon, before you roll damage, you can use a bonus action and expend a charge to roll all of the attack's damage dice twice and add them together (this includes all effects triggered by this attack, such as the doubled damage dice from a critical hit, Sneak Attack and Divine Smite).

Once the damage has been dealt, the weapon gains a -1 modifier to damage, applied after all other bonuses and penalties.  Penalties can accumulate up to -5.  Mundane weapons break and shatter at this point, while magical or otherwise unbreakable weapons will remain intact, but become unusable as weapons until repaired.

Weapons can be repaired at a blacksmith, or by any character with Smith's Tools proficiency.  The cost to repair at a blacksmith is 5 gp per penalty level for mundane weapons, or 50 gp per penalty level for magical or adamantine weapons.  Repairs by a character with Smith's Tools proficiency cost 2 gp per penalty level for mundane weapons, or 25 gp per penalty level for magical and adamantine weapons.  Characters may repair 1 penalty level per 2 hours during a period of non-stressful activity.

This steel shield hides a slim chamber in its center where magical flora grow and release their toxic pollen.  The chamber is covered using an intricate, interlocking series of metal plates and flaps that, once released, resembles a flower.

When a Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of you misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to block the attack with your shield and  use the impact to release the chamber's mechanism: exposing and releasing the flowers' pollen in the face of the attacking creature.  That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 3d10 poison damage and be poisoned for 1 minute.  On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn't poisoned.  Once the pollen has been released in this way, this property of the shield can't be used again until the following dusk when the flowers release another wave of pollen.

Curious, whirring mechanisms inside the shield automatically retract the chamber's unfurled metallic plates at dusk.  Alternatively, you can manually collapse the chamber's coverings over the course of 1 minute.</rich_text>

As a reaction to taking damage from the element matching the attuned ring, or to an ally within 15 feet taking damage from the element matching the attuned ring, you can use 1 or more charges and reduce matching elemental damage taken by 2d10 per charge used (for example, a Signet of Fire Warding can reduce fire damage by 2d10 per charge).  The ring regains 1d4-1 charges after a short rest.  If the ring is reduced to 0 charges, roll a d20.  On a roll of 1, the ring loses its magical power and becomes a normal silver ring worth 10 gp.

These two enchanted daggers hail from the expansive Eidosi Underdark, home of the decimated Drow Kingdom. Crafted as a matching set.

Fate, a wicked throwing blade, it's ebony handle wreathed in silver accent bears a hedronically cut red stone in the pommel. Fate adds a +1 bonus to all attack and damage rolls made with the weapon, and all successful attacks deal maximum rolled weapon damage (4 + 1 bonus + your damage modifier). Fate cannot deal critical hit damage, even on a natural 20. Fate can be used to apply sneak attack damage, but all extra damage from sneak attacks are automaticly rolled at half the maximum.

Fortune is Fate's twin, though the black grip is instead accepted with gold, and a sapphire adorns the pommel. Fortune deals 1 point of necrotic damage to the attacker whenever it is used to make a melee weapon attack. On a successful hit, roll a d20. If the result of the roll is 15 or higher, Fortune deals an additional 12d10 necrotic, or 100 necrotic damage, whichever is more.

Fate and Fortune count as a single weapon for purposes of attunement. Both daggers' enchantments only activate when within 150 feet of eachother and attuned to the same creature. Seperately, their enchantments deactivate and both function as normal daggers until brought back within range.

The beetles bite and hamper the creature for its next 1d4 turns.

Once this arrow has been drawn, you can use your bonus action to focus on the arrow and activate its icy evocation magic until the end of your next turn.  If used to make a ranged weapon attack, the attack deals cold damage instead of its normal type.  If the hit target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be frozen solid, effectively petrified, until the end of your next turn.  If the target has resistance to cold damage, it has advantage on the saving throw, and if it is immune it automatically succeeds.  If the target takes any fire damage while petrified, the effect ends immediately.

When used separately, each weapon is a +1 shortsword, and when attuned to both swords, they only take up one attunement slot.

When attuned to both swords, you may attack with both swords as part of a single Attack action.  If you have the Extra Attack feature, you may attack this way for each attack.  Only one of these attacks may benefit from the “power attack” feature from the Power Striker feat, or similar effects.
Roll both attack rolls before rolling damage.  If either attack roll is a 1, both attacks miss.  If either attack roll is a critical hit, only the damage dice for one of  the weapons is doubled.  If both attack rolls are critical hits, the damage dice for both weapons are rolled thrice instead of twice.
Your modifier only applies once across both weapons, but each weapon's magical modifiers apply to their own attack, in a manner similar to how damage would be applied if you had attacked with both weapons separately as part of two weapon fighting.
When you attack with Melody &amp; Chorus in this way, you may not attack with them as part of a bonus action.</rich_text>

						<rich_text>

This roughly hewn crystalline sword bends light in unexpected and dangerous ways. As an action, you can command the scimitar to emit up to 2 ghostly projections of itself. The sword can have up to 2 of these projections at any time, which last until dismissed (no action required). When you make a melee attack with this weapon, the projections become razor-sharp. Targets hit by the sword take an extra 1d4 slashing damage for each projection the sword has.

When swung, the distorted light and projections make the sword difficult to see. When you miss with a melee attack using the sword while it has at least 1 projection, you can choose to reroll the attack using 1 of the projections. You must use the new roll. After the attack, the projection fades.

The sword emits dim light in a 5-foot radius while it has 1 projection and 10 feet while it has 2. Sheathing the scimitar contains the projections' light without dismissing them.</rich_text>

Nightmare feeds off of the fear and terror of its victims. Any melee attack made against frightened creatures with this weapon deals an additional 2d6 psychic damage.

As an action you slam Nightmare on the ground and expend one charge to release Nightmare's accumulated baleful aura in full force. Every creature of your choice with 30ft. radius that can see or hear you must make a DC (DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of your next turn.

						<rich_text>

This magical piece of ammunition is fletched with enchanted phoenix feathers and grants you a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The bolt or arrow is magically bound to a small quiver. When fired, the bolt or arrow bursts into flame upon impacting its target and deals magical fire damage instead of piercing from the attack. At the start of your next turn, the arrow is consumed by the flames and reappears in the quiver it was bound to.

You can speak the ammunition's command word as a bonus action to set it ablaze before loosing the bolt or arrow. When you do, the ammunition begins its magical process early and burns out if shot beyond 30 feet. If fired in this way, the bolt or arrow deals an additional 1d6 fire damage and immediately reappears in the bound quiver after the attack.

You can store other arrows in the quiver, but can only have one Phoenix Arrow bound to the quiver at a time. If the arrow is ever destroyed, it reappears in the quiver after 24 hours. Firing the arrow into an antimagic field renders it nonmagical while it's within the field, allowing it to be permanently destroyed while in that state.

						<rich_text style="italic">Weapon (any crossbow), rare (requires attunement)</rich_text>
						<rich_text>

This magical crossbow grants the wielder a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the weapon.

The crossbow comes with a special needle-like bolt that is magically bound to it. When fired, this bolt leaves a faint thread of ethereal energy behind it as it flies. Creatures struck by the bolt take force damage instead of piercing, as it effortlessly passes through them. Immediately after making an attack, the bolt flies back to the crossbow and reloads itself neatly, making it immediately ready for another shot. When the needle-like bolt is used, this crossbow ignores the loading property.

This weapon has 4 charges, recharging 1d4 each dawn. You can expend a charge following a successful attack with the crossbow to attach the bolt's arcane thread to a point on the ground within 5 feet of the target. If the tethered creature attempts to move more than 10 feet away from that point before the end of your next turn, it must succeed on a DC16 Strength saving throw or be forced to remain within 10 feet of the point you chose until the start of its next turn.

While attuned to this weapon, you can cast the mending cantrip at will.

If this crossbow's unique bolt is somehow destroyed or lost, the bolt reappears, already loaded into the crossbow, after 24 hours so long as both the bolt and crossbow are on the same plane of existence. The crossbow functions as a normal, nonmagical weapon while separated from the bolt.

						<rich_text weight="heavy">Curse.</rich_text>

On a failure, you are overcome with the urge to craft and are forced to sew, knit, crochet, or cross-stitch feverishly for at least an hour before being able to rest. When firing the crossbow, you can sometimes hear the bolt giggle as it careens towards its target. The curse remains even if the attunement ends, but can be undone by any effect that removes a curse such as a greater restoration or remove curse spell.</rich_text>

Asedal, a wizard famous for his paranoia and conviction that his magical secrets were being stolen. He created this wide primed pointy hat, both to keep his books and scrolls close but also to keep his enemies reading his mind.

You gain a +1 bonus to all Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma saving throws while you are wearing this hat. The hat also contains an extra dimensional space 1 foot in diameter at the mouth and 2 feet deep. The hat can hold up to 20 pounds not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The hat weighs less than 1 pound, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the hat requires an action. If the hat is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the hat is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the hat must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the hat can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.

Placing the hat inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

This heart-shaped necklace has a ruby gem locket on its end. While a creature is wearing this locket, they become made aware if anyone else wearing an identical locket is in deadly danger. For clarification, these are always found or made in a set, and don't work with other lockets not made at the same time as it (at the DM's discretion, there may be some way of connecting different heartache lockets, allowing some expansion to the set). 

When any creature wearing one of a set of these falls unconscious at 0 hit points or dies (whichever comes first), the ruby of every heartache locket in the set begins to glow a bright red glow that darkens slightly before lighting up again in a pattern of the individual wearer's heartbeat, and also warms up to a noticeable amount. This effect occurs regardless of where the wearers are, even across planes. The gem then emits red bright light in a 5-foot radius from the wearer, and dim light for another 5 feet. The glow and warmth lasts an hour until all necklaces stop glowing, though they are reusable and end early if all wearers recover to at least 1 hit point. Finally, all of the necklaces have the Unbreakable minor property, making it impossible to do something to the wearer that prevents the effect from occurring, except for using a wish to destroy the locket before killing the wearer.

This mythral gauntlet runs up to the user's right elbow, and the back of the hand has a socket in the center.  

While attuned to the gauntlet, you can use an action to place a gem into the socket, giving the glove charges.  The number of charges gained depends on the gem inserted, and the glove has a maximum capacity of 9 charges.  Once a gem is placed into the socket, it is locked into place, and cannot be removed by any means.  Once all of the charges granted by the gem are used, the gem darkens, cracks, and disintegrates into dust, leaving the socket free for a new gem.

When casting a spell, you can use a charge to overload the spell, choosing from one of the following effects: 
• If the spell deals damage, heals, or otherwise has an effect that involves rolling dice to determine the scale of an effect, such as sleep, the damage/healing/effect dice become Exploding.
• If the spell has a duration of some sort, you can use a charge to double the duration.  You cannot increase a duration beyond 24 hours in this way.
• If the spell is a ritual spell, you can use a charge to use the spell’s normal casting time instead of the ritual casting time.

You cannot use more than one charge per turn.  If you use a charge effect on a spell that requires concentration, the base DC becomes 12 instead of 10.

This snowglobe appears to have a red barn surrounded by sprawling fields within, with moving creatures populating it.

You may use an action and touch the snow globe to a willing creatures head to store the creature within.  If they are not willing, nothing happens.

Your creature will be fed and taken care of by the globe's vibrantly colored inhabitants, for a cost.  You may store as many creatures as you wish, but the fee will increase based on the number of creatures stored within. 

Fees must be paid once a week.  The first 3 creatures you store only cost 5 gp, but each creature you store following costs an additional 1 gp.

There is a coin slot through which you can insert the required payment, as well as a series of glowing golden numbers which indicate how much is owed, and when the next payment is due.  The globe accepts platinum coin as well as gold to ease larger payments.  You can insert coin beyond what is owed, and the globe will retain credit up to 50 gp, applied to outstanding debt.  Any additional gold or platinum inserted beyond 50 gp will not increase the credit you have, but the coin will not be returned.

If you do not pay the fee your pets are sent back to you at the same time you sent them in. They appear at any point of your sight within 10ft. A pet may be summoned as an action, but if summoned in combat, your pet will appear on the next initiative count 20.

No creature with an Intelligence score of 8 or higher can enter the farm. You and any other PCs cannot be transported into the pet farm.

A seed of the forgotten is a small, slightly transparent, red seed, which are said to, at times, fall out of planar rifts, and on the very odd occasion, plant themselves.

If a seed of the forgotten is eaten as is, it allows the eater to create a very mild mental block, allowing protection of their choice of minute information (such as their age, name, or place of birth) about themselves to be taken from their mind, using any form of magic, or natural ability, such as the detect thoughts spell.

Eating more than one seed of the forgotten is extremely dangerous, and causes the eater to themselves forget what they had previously blocked others from discovering.

If a seed of the forgotten is planted, it will take a week to bloom into a small, light red flower, which, if eaten, can cause the eater to forget years of their own lives.

The petals of a flower of the forgotten, can be used to create a potent memory-erasing potion, after consuming said potion, the drinker will forget the last 1d6 days.

The warrant has 1d4 + 1 charges. While this warrant is on your person, you can use an action to speak its command word to expend one charge and regain one expended spell slot from your Pact Magic feature.

The first time you regain a spell slot with the warrant, you hear a constant whispering noise from your surroundings, and your mind suffer an eldritch stress and terror as the noise intensifies, taking 2d8 psychic damage for each level of the spell slot you regained. Each time you regain a spell slot again before finishing a long rest, the psychic damage per spell slot increases by 1d8. This damage ignores your resistance and immunity.

The warrant regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the warrant’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the warrant crumbles into dust, spraying pitch-black and foul-smelling ink all over the place.

This dark hooded lantern glows with a magical blue flame and can reveal the demise of a creature no longer among the living. The lantern sheds bright, bluish light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. You can use an action to reduce the light's reach or cover it completely.

The lantern has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges each day at dusk. As an action, you can expend a charge by touching it to a Large or smaller corpse within 5 feet of you. When you do, a ghostly blue illusion of the fallen creature appears above its corpse to silently reenact the last 6 seconds of its life. The illusion only shows the creature's actions and reactions, such as reacting to an unseen monster or trying to extinguish the flames of a fiery trap, but does not show the monster or effect causing the actions or reactions. This ability has no effect on undead creatures. Once a corpse's death has been revealed in this way, it cannot be shown again.

Alternatively, you can expend a charge as an action while holding the lantern aloft and speaking its command word. If there are any undead creatures within 60 feet of you that are not behind total cover, the lantern's light flashes a foreboding red color before returning to its normal blue glow.

You have a swimming speed of 60 feet and can breathe underwater while you wear this shark-skinned cloak.  If a creature successfully grapples or restrains you by touching you, that creature takes 1d4 piercding damage upon that success and again at the end of each of its subsequent turns while it continues to physically hold you.

In addition, the cloak magically sharpens your teeth.  If you make a melee attack while underwater against a creature on your turn, you can use a bonus action to make a bite attack against the same creature if it's below its hit point maximum.  This attack uses a damage die of 1d4, deals piercing damage, and uses your Strength modifier when rolling for attack and damage.  The target can't be a construct, plant or undead creature.

This ring holds a specialized extra-planar space within it.  Over the course of a short or long rest, while you are attuned to this ring you can focus on a weapon and store it within this ring.  You can store up to 5 weapons in this way, although you can only store 1 weapon per short rest, and 2 weapons per long rest.  Weapons stored this way become Ring-bonded Weapons.  You must be attuned to weapons that require attunement in order to store them, and storing a weapon you are attuned to breaks attunement.  You cannot store cursed weapons in this way, and you can only store sentient weapons if they agree to be stored.  You can summon a Ring-bonded weapon as a bonus action, and if it requires attunement, it will instantly attune to you.  If you have 3 attunements when you summon an attunement weapon, it will break your oldest attunement that is not the Ordnance Bond.  If a weapon remains out of your grasp for more than 1 minute, it automatically returns to storage within the Ordnance Bond.

All weapons stored within the Ordnance Bond remain stored if you break attunement to this item, and those weapons can be summoned by the next creature to attune to it, although they will need to spend time attuning to any weapons requiring attunement before they can store those weapons again after summoning them.

At first glance, it appears to be just a hilt with a hole in the pommel. However, if you slowly fill the hole with a liquid while attuning to the hilt, a blade appears.

Once you have attuned to the blade, you can create a new blade at any time by taking 1 minute to pour liquid into the hilt and channel your focus into the weapon.

An Alchemist's Blade deals damage equivalent to the weapon type it is templated on, plus an additional damage dice matching the weapons base type, and damage type determined by the liquid used to make the blade. Some blades may also cause an additional effect (for example, the Alchemist’s Hilt is a shortsword, it will deal 1d6 damage + 2d6 damage matching the type of liquid used to make it).

</rich_text>
						<rich_text weight="heavy">Blade Breaker.</rich_text>
						<rich_text> If you roll a 1 on an attack using this weapon, or if you deliberately break the blade by succeeding a DC 15 Strength saving throw, the blade explodes. When this occurs, everyone in a 15 ft. by 15 ft. sphere centred on the weapon, including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, you take 3d6 damage, with the damage type being the one associated with the blade (e.g. if the Venomous Blade explodes, take 3d6 poison damage.) On a successful save, you take half damage. The hilt is left empty but unharmed.

Some blades may be destroyed without causing the Blade Breaker effect. For example, the Flammable Blade burns out after 1 hour, and the Frozen Blade melts after 1 hour, both leaving only the hilt. These blades will still trigger the Blade Breaker effect if broken in any other way, however.

After 24 hours, the blade breaks without triggering the Blade Breaker feature. You must spend a short rest creating a new blade, as described in the Attunement section.

When you do, you suffer 3d8 necrotic damage, and the weapon deals 3d8 necrotic damage to the target.  You then gain temporary hit points equal to half the necrotic damage dealt to the target.  Once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or a long rest.

While you remain attuned to this weapon, your maximum hit points are reduced by an amount equal to your level.  When you unattune from this weapon, you suffer 2d8 necrotic damage.</rich_text>

This flintlock pistol is forged from a lightly colored steel alloy, and lovingly embroidered with platinum in-lays, as well as red and green gems. Attunement with the pistol is required to remove it from its similarly decorated holster.

This magical pistol has a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls, in addition to dealing and additional 1d6 radiant damage when wielded by a good-aligned creature. As an action, a good-aligned creature can reload the gun using their pure thoughts, concentrating on it as though concentrating on a spell. When doing so, the damage of the pistol becomes radiant instead of piercing damage, and it loses the misfire and loading properties.  When concentrating on the pistol in this way, it can be fired without needing to be reloaded.</rich_text>

On a result of 6 or higher, the shot turns into a Devil Shot.  A Devil Shot has a Misfire score of 6.  

If you hit with a Devil Shot attack, you deal an additional 1d10 fire damage and 1d10 necrotic damage.  Once you have fired a Devil Shot, you cannot benefit from this feature again until you reload.</rich_text>

This spear can slip through the ethereal plane to reach its destination. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals force damage instead of piercing damage. When you take the Attack action with the spear, you can choose a point you can see within 20 feet of you. The end of the spear vanishes and reappears at that point, allowing you to make melee weapon attacks with the spear against a creature in or adjacent to that space until the end of your turn. You ignore half-cover with these attacks and treat three-quarters cover as if it were half cover.

You can use a bonus action to see 60 feet into the ethereal plane for one minute, and can use the spear to attack creatures you can see on that plane. Once you use this ability to see into the other plane, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

This magic spear is made of dark, polished granite and has a large ruby set in its head.  While made of stone, it weighs no more than a normal spear and is enchanted to prevent it from shattering.  You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

This spear has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges each day at dawn.  While standing on unworked stone or earth, you can expend 1 charge as an action to plunge the spear into the ground.  The spear vanishes into the ground and emerges as a sharp stone spike that's 1 foot wide and 10 foot long from another surface made of unworked stone or earth that you can see within 60 feet of you, such as the ground or a cave wall.  The spike erupts from the surface and forces any creature within a line 5 feet wide and 10 feet long to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.  On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 piercing damage and is pushed up to 5 feet away from the spike.  On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and is not pushed.

You can recover the spear by speaking its command word as a bonus action while in or adjacent to a space occupied by the stone spike.  When you do, the spike disintegrates and falls away, leaving only the spear at its center.  The spike lasts for 1 minute or until you reclaim it in this way.</rich_text>

You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, equal to the number of charges it currently holds. Timber gains a charge every time you hit a creature or object with it, up to a maximum of three charges. When Timber gains its third charge, the built-up force explodes; it loses all charges, and the target suffers an additional 3d6 force damage, or 6d6 if it is made of wood. When this happens, if the target is no more than one size larger than you, you can allow the force to push it up to 10 feet away from you.

Timber's charges last for 1 minute, but it loses all charges if you make an attack against a different target than your previous attack, or if you make an attack (with any weapon) and do not hit your target with Timber.

This thick woven cloth bag is tied shut with a rope. Holding the bag, it feels as if its lumpy contents are jostling about.

When the bag is opened, you can use an action to remove one of 7 wizards from the bag at random, rolling 1d8 to determine which wizard you pull from those shown below. If you roll the number 8, or any die roll that's associated with a wizard that has already been used, reroll. Wizards that died while in the bag can still be retrieved, their corpse vanishing 10 minutes after being pulled out. When a wizard is removed from the bag, it will be charmed by you and obey your verbal commands, but will disappear after 10 minutes. None of the wizards in the bag are sentient, but behave as if they were, and have distinct (albeit simple) personalities. If the bag is opened and unattended, roll a d20 every minute. On a 1, a wizard will wander out of the bag on its own accord, in which case it will act unpredictably, not charmed by anyone. If the bag is submerged in water for 1 minute, all wizards in the bag will die. The bag can also be used as a bludgeoning weapon that deals 1d6 damage, but if you roll a 1 to hit, one of the wizards in the bag dies at random.

Each wizard resembles a small, bipedal kitten with an oversized head that disappears after 10 minutes or when it dies. Once a wizard dies or vanishes, it is gone for good. Once all wizards are removed from the bag, it ceases being a magic item.

						<rich_text style="italic">Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a Ranger Companion)</rich_text>
						<rich_text>

A small unassuming gold-blue platinum ear band with an eyeball design inscribed onto its surface, it gently hums with magical energy.  The power within the band allows the creature attuned to it to adapt and learn from its opponents, granting the ability to adjust its body dynamically based on the abilities it is attempting to copy.  

When a Ranger’s companion is attuned to this item, their intellect increases to 10 if it is not already equal to or higher, and they can learn features from opposing creatures according to the list below, or at the DM’s digression.  The companion gains two new Actions they can take on their turn in combat, Observe and Learn.  Observe allows your companion to study a creature, and is used in the acquisition of Passive Features and skills.  Learn allows your companion to gain an Active or Passive Feature for themselves, represented by a Learn check, which is a d20 roll plus your companions Intelligence modifier.  A companion can have up to 4 Active Features and 1 Passive Feature.  All features available for companions to learn, and what creatures they are learned from as well as any relevant details about the feature are listed in the Azure Library Feature Table document.  When a creature learns a new Active Feature, it is added to their selection of Active Features immediately.  If they already have 4 Active Features, you must choose to replace one of the existing features.  When a creature learns a new Passive Feature it is active on your companion immediately, replacing any existing Passive Features they may have.

After witnessing an Active Feature listed on the Azure Library Feature Table, your companion can take the Learn action targeting the feature, the DC of which is described on the Azure Library Feature Table.  On success, your companion learns the feature.  On a failure, your companion does not learn the feature, the DC increases by 1, and cannot attempt to learn it again until the feature is used again.  If the feature is used multiple times before your companion uses Learn targeting the feature, the DC decreases by 1 per use.  The DC reduction resets after the next Learn attempt is made targeting that feature.  If the feature is used directly in an interaction with your companion in some way (an attack against your companion or in defense against an attack from your companion), your companion can make the Learn check with advantage.

In order to learn a Passive Feature listed on the Azure Library Feature Table, your companion must spend at least 3 turns observing the creature possessing the desired feature.  After your companion has taken the Observe action for 3 turns, they may take the Learn action on their next turn.  The DC for the Learn check decreases by 1 for each additional sequential turn past the 3rd they spend taking the Observe action.  If you are not actively engaged in combat with a creature possessing the desired feature, your companion can spend 10 minutes Observing the creature, learning the feature when the time has passed.

When you are attempting a skill check you are proficient in, you can have your companion take the Observe action before you roll.  Doing so means that you cannot benefit from advantage on the check.  If you succeed on 5 skill checks with your companion Observing, your companion gains half-proficiency (rounded down) with that skill.  Succeeding on a total of 10 skill checks this way grants your companion full proficiency in that skill.  If you possess prowess in a skill, succeeding on a total of 20 skill checks in this way grants your companion prowess in that skill.  Your companion can observe others making skill checks that they are proficient in, but they must be aware they are being Observed and be willing to help your companion learn.  Your companion may gain proficiency in up to 3 different skills this way.

In addition, these boots come with 3 charges.  While wearing them, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges and click your heels together to cast the haste spell on yourself.

Whenever you kill a creature with radiant or fire damage, the flames cover the creature and almost seem to expand. Any creature within 5 feet of the creature that you killed takes 2d6 fire or radiant damage.

The Pocket Dimension is a portable gateway to a private space which is unaffected by the world outside. The Pocket Dimension appears as a small glass sphere with a white platform inside of it. When rubbed, the sphere will teleport the user, anything the user is touching or holding onto with their hands, and anyone else touching the sphere at the time into itself. Within the Pocket Dimension there is a white platform made of an unknown stone-like material. The platform is 20ft by 20ft and the roof is 20ft upward. The platform is surrounded lined with black, non-transparent, glass-like walls.

If the Pocket Dimension is rubbed whilst being held in the user's two hands, the sphere will fall to the ground directly below where it was. Onlookers who are to look at the sphere can see a real-time, miniaturized version of what is happening inside the sphere through the sphere's glass surface.

To exit the Pocket Dimension, users within the sphere can rub the black, glass walls to be teleported out.

Teleporting into or out of the Pocket Dimension takes one action if used during combat. As the Pocket Dimension is a magical item, both the interior and exterior of the Pocket Dimension is indestructible.

This slender, iridescent lance is covered in an enchanted finish that resembles the hardened scales of many dragons. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While attuned to the weapon, you can understand and speak Draconic.

The lance has 8 charges and regains 1d4+4 expended charges each day at dawn. When you hit a target with a melee weapon attack using the lance, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 3d6 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage with the attack. If you expend a charge in this way when you hit a dragon, it must also succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the beginning of your next turn. For the purpose of this weapon, &quot;dragon&quot; refers to any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles and wyverns.

Whenever you expend a charge in this way to deal extra damage, you can choose to expend a second charge and deal an additional 1d6 damage of the same type to the target and prevent it from using its reaction until the start of its next turn.

In addition, you can use the lance to cast the &quot;find steed&quot; spell. Once you cast it, you cannot do so again until the following dawn. When you cast the spell, you can choose to summon a dragon wyrmling instead by expending a number of charges equal to its challenge rating (maximum 2). You determine the kind of dragon summoned, although its alignment towards good or evil must be the same as your own. If your alignment is neutral, you can summon a wyrmling of either alignment. The wyrmling counts as one size larger when used as a mount and cannot use its breath weapons to attack.

The next melee weapon attack you land against a creature using this blade while it sheds light deals an additional 6d6 damage of the dragon breath's damage type.

The trident has a chain attached to its handle that can be used to retrieve the weapon once it's been thrown using a bonus action. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an additional 1d8 lightning damage.

In addition, this trident acts as a conduit for the sky's ferocious power. Immediately after hitting a creature with the trident, you can call down a bolt of lightning upon it, forcing it and all creatures within 5 feet to make a DC16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, creatures take 6d10 lightning damage, or half as much on a success. Creatures have disadvantage on the saving throw if they're submerged in water or wearing metal armor.

If you have damaged a creature with Yamato this turn, you may cast Misty Step at will, without using a spell slot or components.

This cut red gemstone seems to glint with some sort of liquid inside.  The gem is impervious to attacks and damaging effects.  The gem contains magic absorbed from countless other sources that it uses to overpower the requirements of certain item attunements.  While holding the gem against another item that requires attunement by a class or race other than you, you can attune to the new item nonetheless.  The new item can be neither legendary nor an artifact.  The gem fuses to the surface of the new item and encases the area around it in a crystaline shell.

You can unattune to the new item as normal, even if the item is cursed.  Unattuning to cursed items in this way breaks the curse's effects on you.  When you unattune to the new item, the gem detatches from the item, allowing you to use it on another item.  The crystal absorbs any of the item's magic when it's removed in this way, causing the item to become mundane and nonmagical once you unattune to it.</rich_text>

This anvil of pure mythril was forged in primordial flame and has been engraved with hundreds of runes, all of which glow softly. 

If a magical object is destroyed upon this anvil using its paired mythril hammer, the enchanted dust that remains can be used to transfer the enchantment to another compatible mundane item, or modify the enchantment on another magical item.  Destroying a magical item takes 8 hours, or 2 hours if you are proficient with Smith’s tools.  Enchanted dust retains its potency for 1 day if not properly stored in an enchanted glass vial worth at least 100 gp, after which time it loses any of its magical properties and becomes mundane dust.  While properly stored, the enchanted dust will not lose its potency.

Once you have the enchanted dust from an item, you can place a compatible mundane item on the anvil and sprinkle the dust over it, spending 8 hours infusing the magical essence into the object, or 2 hours if you are proficient in Arcana.  When magical properties are transferred in this way, the mundane object gains the magical properties of the item that was destroyed, except with the properties of the base mundane item (for example, is a Flametongue longsword is destroyed and the dust is applied to a rapier, the resultant item is a Flametongue rapier).  If you attempt to apply the magical dust to an incompatible item, nothing will happen as the enchanted dust will not bond with the item in question, no matter how much time is spent (for example, if you attempt to apply Vorpal Weapon dust to a warhammer, the dust will not bond properly and nothing will happen).

You can also attempt to add or modify enchantments on other magical items.  In order to outright add an enchantment to another magical object, the target object must be compatible with the enchantment on the destroyed item per your DM’s digression.  After spending 8 hours performing the combination ritual, you must make an Arcana check to see if you are able to combine the new enchantment with the existing enchantment, the difficulty of which is 10 + the destroyed items rarity mod + the target items rarity mod, found on the Modification Difficulty Table.  On a successful check, the enchantment from the dust is applied to the item placed on the anvil.  The enchantment is transferred exactly, as with transferring to a mundane item.  On a failure, the enchantment is not applied to the target item.  If the check is failed by 5 or more, the target item is destroyed.  Alternatively, on a failure of 5 or more, the target item could receive an entirely new enchantment (determined by the DM).  Regardless of a success or failure, the enchanted dust is consumed.

To modify an enchantment, you must take an existing item with a property that is reasonably adjustable, and apply enchanted dust with properties similar to the intended result.  This process is done at the digression of the DM, who will verify whether or not a modification is possible, and whether or not items are valid as modification catalysts.  An example of a modification that could be made is changing the fire damage on a Flametongue into lightning damage by infusing it with enchanted dust from a Javelin of Lightning.  To modify an enchantment, you must spend 8 hours performing the modification ritual, after which time you must make an Arcana check, the DC of which is 10 + the target items rarity mod.  On a success, the enchantment on the item is modified as intended.  On a failure, the enchantment on the target item is unchanged.  On a failure of 5 or more, the target item also loses all of its existing magical properties and becomes mundane.  Alternatively, if the check fails by 5 or more, the target item does not lose its enchantment, but instead changes in an unintended way (determined by the DM).  Regardless of a success or failure, the enchanted dust is consumed.

Each additional time you attempt to add an enchantment or modify an enchantment on an item, the base difficulty of the check increases by 2.

The Deck of Fates and Favors is comprised of a full deck of tarot cards, similar to a Deck of Many Things. Unlike the Deck of Many Things, however, cards in the Deck of Fates and Favors have primarily positive effects. No cards are ever missing from a Deck of Fates and Favors, whether found or purchased. The deck will allow a number of individuals stated as part of its attunement to draw a single card. Once the individuals have drawn their cards, the deck vanishes into thin air and reappears at a random location on a random plane with its missing cards restored.  A card's effect does not occur until torn in half, and once a character has benefitted from a card, they cannot benefit from the same card again.  If they draw a card they have benefitted from before, they may put the card they drew back into the deck, and draw another card.

					<rich_text>Wondrous Item, rare
This magic wooden wardrobe has enough space for several articles of clothing hung on its hanger, or can fit one suit of armor of any weight. You can immediately unequip whatever armor or clothing they are currently wearing and replace it with any armor or clothes stored in the wardrobe. The range of the wardrobe extends for a minimum of 100 miles. If the user wants to teleport clothes to them from over that distance, up to 200 miles away, there is an X% chance (where X is the distance past 100 miles) that the equipment on its way to or from the wardrobe will be lost somewhere in the middle.
    The wardrobe can only teleport armor and clothes. Any coins or messages stored in a pocket will remain with the user, and be in the pocket of whatever clothes they replace it with, or fall to the floor if the clothing has no pockets. Non-magical accessories such as hair ribbons and jewelry can be transported, but not makeup.

Domination bands come into two parts, a collar and a bracelet; both collar and bracelet are marked to match a set. Subjugation bands are developed with a metal loop that allows a wire or rope to link the two pieces. If the collar is placed around someone's neck, they are unable to remove it themselves and become incapacitated if they try.

When the bracelet is worn the person who put it on the wearer is able to perceive the emotions of the one wearing the collar and to induce physical sensations in the one wearing the collar at will, such as pain, pleasure and nausea. The one wearing the bracelet can also induce paralysis in the one wearing the collar at will.

While both the collar and bracelet are being worn, each wearer can determine the location of the other so long as both occupy the same plane.

If one wearing the bracelet takes damage, anyone wearing the linked collar takes double non-lethal psychic damage.

Someone wearing the collar cannot hold a weapon or use spellcasting abilities without permission from the one wearing the bracelet. They will instead experience extreme pain every time they make an attempt until they stop.

The collar can only be removed by the one wearing the linked bracelet, through remove curse, or as an action while within an antimagic field.

			<rich_text>Sinncubi are the iconic depiction of lust. Feared for their typically evil nature and ability to steal one's soul, Sinncubi are fiends who wield subtle illusions and enchantments to tempt their victims into forfeiting their eternal souls. Sinncubi inhabit all of the Lower Planes, and the lascivious dark-winged fiends can be found in service to devils, demons, night hags, rakshasas, and yugoloths. Asmodeus, ruler of the Nine Hells, uses these fiends to tempt mortals to perform evil acts. The demon lord Graz'zt keeps succubi and incubi as advisers and consorts.

Sinncubi often live up to their reputation, acting as seductive females or males to lure males and/or females into relinquishing some of their life-force. Particularly adept at controlling others in the peak of their strength, they're often employed - albeit reluctantly - by others to act as crowd control, or to tame certain creatures. Most of them share the nature of their reputation; flirtatious. They avoid fighting where possible, instead choosing seduction or fleeing.

The gender-neutral term for Succubi and Incubi is usually either Foocubus or Concubus.

## Physical Description  
Succubi in their true forms have an appearance similar to that of humans, but are horned, clawed, tailed, winged, and comely. They are typically slender, well toned, and are very rarely overly muscular. Due to their shapechanging abilities, they can tweak their appearances or even change them completely to suit their needs. 

## Names
Succubi tend to have names in the Abyssal or Infernal language, and may also take on a wide variety of pseudonyms in their interactions with other races and cultures. 

## Sinncubus Traits
Beautiful fiends who thrive on the corruption of mortal souls.  

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity and Charisma scores each increase by 1.  

**Age.** Sinncubi are ageless demons, typically reaching adulthood between the ages of 15 and 19 and will not die of old age.  

**Alignment.** Due to their fiendish natures, succubi often tend toward evil alignments. Neutral or good succubi are extremely rare, but not unheard of. They have no particular tendency toward or against lawful or chaotic alignments.  

**Size.** Succubi are shapeshifters; however, in general, they are similar in size to most other humanoid races. Your size is Medium.  

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.  

**Devilsight.** Because you are a fiend, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 60 feet.

**Fiendish Nature.** Your creature type is considered to be both Fiend and Humanoid, and you are considered to have the &quot;Shapechanger&quot; tag.  

**Infernal Shapechanger** As an action, you can change your appearance and your voice, or revert to your natural form. You determine the specifics of the changes, including your coloration, hair length, and sex. You can also adjust your height and weight, but not so much that your size changes. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race; you lose the flying speed granted by your wings trait if your current form does not have wings; otherwise none of your game statistics change.. You can’t duplicate the appearance of a creature you’ve never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have. Your clothing and equipment aren’t changed by this trait.

You stay in the new form until you use an action to revert to your true form or until you die.

Even to the most astute observers, your ruse is usually indiscernible. If you rouse suspicion, or if a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make to avoid detection of your true nature.

**Silver Tongue.** You have proficiency with the Persuasion skill. If you spend 1 minute talking to someone who can understand what you say, you can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by the creature's Wisdom (Insight) check. If you or your companions are fighting the creature, your check automatically fails. If your check succeeds, the target is magically charmed by you as long as it remains within 60 feet of you.  

**Wings.** You have a pair of wings that give you a flying speed of 30 feet. You cannot use this fly speed if you are wearing medium or heavy armor or if your current form granted by your shapechanger trait does not have wings.  

**Languages.** You can read, speak, and write Common, Abyssal, and Infernal.</rich_text>
