> This roughly hewn crystalline sword bends light in unexpected and dangerous ways. As an action, you can command the scimitar to emit up to 2 ghostly projections of itself. The sword can have up to 2 of these projections at any time, which last until dismissed (no action required). When you make a melee attack with this weapon, the projections become razor-sharp. Targets hit by the sword take an extra 1d4 slashing damage for each projection the sword has.  
> When swung, the distorted light and projections make the sword difficult to see. When you miss with a melee attack using the sword while it has at least 1 projection, you can choose to reroll the attack using 1 of the projections. You must use the new roll. After the attack, the projection fades.  
> The sword emits dim light in a 5-foot radius while it has 1 projection and 10 feet while it has 2. Sheathing the scimitar contains the projections' light without dismissing them.

> *Weapon (any crossbow), rare (requires attunement)*  
> This magical crossbow grants the wielder a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the weapon.  
> The crossbow comes with a special needle-like bolt that is magically bound to it. When fired, this bolt leaves a faint thread of ethereal energy behind it as it flies. Creatures struck by the bolt take force damage instead of piercing, as it effortlessly passes through them. Immediately after making an attack, the bolt flies back to the crossbow and reloads itself neatly, making it immediately ready for another shot. When the needle-like bolt is used, this crossbow ignores the loading property.  
> This weapon has 4 charges, recharging 1d4 each dawn. You can expend a charge following a successful attack with the crossbow to attach the bolt's arcane thread to a point on the ground within 5 feet of the target. If the tethered creature attempts to move more than 10 feet away from that point before the end of your next turn, it must succeed on a DC16 Strength saving throw or be forced to remain within 10 feet of the point you chose until the start of its next turn.  
> While attuned to this weapon, you can cast the mending cantrip at will.  
> If this crossbow's unique bolt is somehow destroyed or lost, the bolt reappears, already loaded into the crossbow, after 24 hours so long as both the bolt and crossbow are on the same plane of existence. The crossbow functions as a normal, nonmagical weapon while separated from the bolt.  
> **Curse.** Once attuned to this weapon, you must make a DC12 Wisdom saving throw whenever you attempt to take a short or long rest. On a failure, you are overcome with the urge to craft and are forced to sew, knit, crochet, or cross-stitch feverishly for at least an hour before being able to rest. When firing the crossbow, you can sometimes hear the bolt giggle as it careens towards its target. The curse remains even if the attunement ends, but can be undone by any effect that removes a curse such as a greater restoration or remove curse spell.

> While attuned to this weapon, you can see normally in dim light and darkness out to a range of 60 feet, even when the dim light or darkness is magical in nature.  In addition, you can cast darkness at 2nd level centered on yourself.  Once you have cast darkness in this way, you cannot do so again until you have taken a long rest.

> **Spellblade**  
> *Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
> You can use this magic sword as a spellcasting focus for your spells. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals force damage instead of slashing.  
> You can use an action to store a spell of 4th level or lower into the blade. To do this, you cast it as normal, but it does not take effect until you activate it. When you hit a creature or object with an attack using this weapon, you can chose to activate your stored spell, targeting either you or the creature or object you hit with the attack. You can only have one spell stored in this way at a time.

> **Starmetal Striker**  
> *Weapon (light hammer), rare*  
> This light hammer was forged using the remains of a comet and is cold to the touch.  You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

> **Storm Hammer**  
> *Weapon (warhammer), rare*  
> This dwarven warhammer has the thrown (30/90) property in addition to its normal properties.  When you hit a ranged attack with this magic weapon, it deals an additional 1d6 lightning and 1d6 thunder damage.  Immediately after the attack, whether you hit or miss, the weapon flies back to your hand.

> **Storm Lash**  
> *Weapon (whip), rare*  
> This magical whip deals an additional 1d8 lightning damage on hit.  You can choose to attempt to restrain your target instead of dealing damage on a successful attack, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 strength check.  On a failure, the target is grappled and restrained, and can use its action at the end of each of its turns to attempt the check again.  As an action you can choose to make the grappled creature take 2d8 lightning damage.  
> You cannot attack another creature without releasing the grappled creature, and if you move further than 10 feet away from the creature, are incapacitated, or otherwise let go of the whip the grappled creature will no longer be grappled or restrained.

> **Voltedge**  
> *Weapon (any sword), rare*  
> This split metal sword arcs with electricity between its two halves. Targets hit by the sword take an extra 1d6 lightning damage. As an action, you can focus on the sword to unleash a concentrated electrical beam of lightning in a line 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature within that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. Once this property of the sword has been used, it can't be used again until the following dawn.

> **Weapon of the Hunter**  
> *Weapon (any), rare (requires attunement)*  
> While attuned to this weapon, you have advantage on Stealth checks.  When you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature becomes marked.  Subsequent attacks against the marked creature will require the creature to succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, or take an additional amount of damage equal to the base damage of the weapon (for example, a Dagger of the Hunter deals an additional 1d4 piercing damage to a marked target, while a Longsword of the Hunter deals an additional 1d8 slashing or 1d10 slashing if used with two hands).  You also know the exact location of the creature as long as it is within 1 mile of you for the next day.  The mark fades if you attack a different creature, or unattune from the weapon.

> **Blink Dagger**  
> *Weapon (any dagger), very rare*  
> This dagger has 3 charges.  When you throw it you may expend one of the charges and instantly teleport to the dagger’s location and grab hold of it.  The dagger regains all expended charges after a long rest.

> **Deus Ex Calibre**  
> *Weapon (any sidearm), very rare (requires attunement)*  
> This flintlock pistol is forged from a lightly colored steel alloy, and lovingly embroidered with platinum in-lays, as well as red and green gems. Attunement with the pistol is required to remove it from its similarly decorated holster.  
> This magical pistol has a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls, in addition to dealing and additional 1d6 radiant damage when wielded by a good-aligned creature. As an action, a good-aligned creature can reload the gun using their pure thoughts, concentrating on it as though concentrating on a spell. When doing so, the damage of the pistol becomes radiant instead of piercing damage, and it loses the misfire and loading properties.  When concentrating on the pistol in this way, it can be fired without needing to be reloaded.

> *Weapon (Hand Cannon), rare (requries attunement)*  
> You have a +1 bonus to all attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals force damage instead of piercing damage. When you take the Attack action with the spear, you can choose a point you can see within 20 feet of you. The end of the spear vanishes and reappears at that point, allowing you to make melee weapon attacks with the spear against a creature in or adjacent to that space until the end of your turn. You ignore half-cover with these attacks and treat three-quarters cover as if it were half cover.  
> You can use a bonus action to see 60 feet into the ethereal plane for one minute, and can use the spear to attack creatures you can see on that plane. Once you use this ability to see into the other plane, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

When you hit a dragon with this weapon, the dragon takes an extra 2d6 damage of the weapon's type. For the purpose of this weapon, "dragon" refers to any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles and wyverns. In addition, while you are attuned to this weapon, you can read and understand draconic.  
> **Kindled Cleave.** When you are the target of a hostile dragon's breath attack, you can use your reaction to hold the blade in front of you. If you do, the sword cleaves through the breath attack, leaving you and creatures behind you in a 30 foot cone unscathed by the attack. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until the following dawn. If you cleave a breath attack in this way, the blade becomes charged with powerful draconic magic, shedding dim light in a 10 foot radius around the sword the color of the dragon's breath for up to one minute. The next melee weapon attack you land against a creature using this blade while it sheds light deals an additional 6d6 damage of the dragon breath's damage type. This empowered attack cuts through damage resistances, and treats damage immunities as if they were resistances instead.  
> **Lesser Draconic Resistance.** If you roll a saving throw and fail by 4 or less, you can choose to succeed on it instead. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until the following dawn.

> **Storm Thrower Harpoon**

> In addition, this trident acts as a conduit for the sky's ferocious power. Immediately after hitting a creature with the trident, you can call down a bolt of lightning upon it, forcing it and all creatures within 5 feet to make a DC16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, creatures take 6d10 lightning damage, or half as much on a success. Creatures have disadvantage on the saving throw if they're submerged in water or wearing metal armor. You are immune to the lightning damage caused by this effect. This ability fails if the creatures are obstructed from the sky. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until the next dawn.  
> **Impale.** You can use your action to try to impale and pull a creature toward you. If your target is a creature that is no more than one size larger than you, you can make a ranged weapon attack against it using the trident.

> As an action, you can make a single melee attack against a creature you can see within 120 feet of you.  If the attack hits, Yamato deals force damage instead of slashing damage, and you can use a bonus action to teleport to a space next to the target.  Once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you have taken a long rest.  
> If you land a critical hit with Yamato, regardless of the range of your attack, all creatures of your choosing within 5 feet of your target you hit must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, or take the same attack damage as the target of your attack.  
> If you have damaged a creature with Yamato this turn, you may cast Misty Step at will, without using a spell slot or components.  
> If you fall below half of your maximum hit points while wielding Yamato, it loses all of its features except for its bonus to attack and damage rolls.  These features will return when your hit points are back over half of your maximum.

> **Pike of the Forgotten Legion**  
> *Weapon (pike), legendary (requires attunement)*  
> You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  This weapon has 6 charges and regains 1d4+2 expended charges each day at dusk.  While holding the pike, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 16): mirror image (1 charge), phantom steed (1 charge), speak with dead (1 charge), or spirit guardians (2 charges).  
> **Spectral Warrior.** Once on your turn when you hit a creature with an attack using the pike, you can choose to summon a spectral warrior from the weapon.  Until the start of your next turn, that creature is haunted by the warrior.  That creature has disadvantage on any weapon attack it makes against you until the start of your next turn.  This property has no effect against undead creatures.  
> **Haunting Phalanx.** You can use an action while holding the pike to expend 3 charges and point it forward commandingly.  5 spectral, pike-wielding warriors appear before you and march in a 25 by 50-foot line in a direction you choose.  Any creature within that line's area must make a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw.  On a failure, a creature takes 3d10 necrotic and 3d10 psychic damage and are under the effects of the weapon's spectral warriors property.  On a success, the creature takes half damage and isn't affected by the spectral warriors.  Undead creatures automatically succeed on the saving throw.  Once this feature of the pike has been used, it can't be used again until you finish a short or long rest.
