## Common Magical Items

#### Dryadleaf
*Wondrous Item, common*  

This magical plant only grows at the base of trees that are often stepped through by a dryad. Its leaves slowly shift as if brushed by a breeze. Touching the plant, even gently, causes its leaves to stop their gentle swaying for 1 minute. These plants are frequently cultivated by druids to train younger members of their circle to listen with more than just their ears.

Dryadleaf plants only grow up to 4 leaves at a time and are found in the wild with 1d4 matured leaves. Leaves are fully matured once they have a light green edge along their rim. A creature can eat 1 of the plant's fully grown leaves as an action. Once it does, that creature can speak to beasts and plants for 1 minute as if they shared a language. Once picked, a leaf retains this property for 7 days.

A creature can repot the plant following a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check. On a failure, the delicate plant is irreversibly damaged and dies. Once repotted, the plant can survive with surprisingly little air, allowing it to survive in an extradimensional space such as a bag of holding or portable hole. So long as it's watered lightly each day and given a moderate amount of sunlight (weather and environment permitting), the plant grows 1d4 missing leaves every 7 days.

#### Shapeshifter's Circlet
*Wondrous item, common*  

This ivory circlet allows you to recreate some of the natural features of other creatures.  While wearing the circlet, you can spend 1 minute to gently massage your ears, forehead, or temples.  When you do, you can choose to create one of the following features or effects:
• You can cover or replace your own ears with the form of another creature's.
• You can summon one or more horns or antlers atop your head.
• You can change the appearance of your eyes, including their color and pupil shape.

You can only have 1 of these effects active at a time.  The effects last until you dismiss it as a bonus action, remove the circlet, or fall unconscious.  You don't gain any of the senses or abilities of another creature by recreating its physical features in this way.

#### Uorik the Conqueror's Juice Cap
*Wondrous item, common*  

This friendly copper cup changes the flavor of water that's poured into it. As a bonus action, you can whisper the name of a fruit into the mouth of the cup. If the cup is filled with water, its color and flavor change to resemble the kind of juice the fruit makes when juiced. Uttering the name of another fruit into the cup changes its flavor and color again. Regardless of its appearance and flavor, the water is still only water. Shouting into the cup instead causes the juice to effervesce and bubble. If the water is poisoned, the drink tastes foul and badly fermented.

## Uncommon Magical Items

#### Ironleaf Oaken Shield
*Armor (shield), uncommon (requires attunement by a druid)*  

This reinforced wooden shield is covered with ironleaf vines that grant you extra protection.  You gain a +1 bonus to your AC while wielding this shield in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.  In addition, the wooden shield reforms itself to fit you whenever you use your wild shape class feature to transform into a beast.  When you do, the ironleaf vines and wooden shield latch onto your bestial form, granting you a +1 bonus to your AC while transformed in this way.

#### Noggenfogger Elixir
*Potion, uncommon*

When you drink this potion, you must roll a d20. 

* If you roll an odd number, you shrink one size category. For example, a large creature becomes medium. 
* If you roll an even number, all of the clothes and flesh on your body become transparent and you appear as a skeleton. 

The effects of this potion last 10 minutes.

#### Autumn Cloak
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

While wearing this cloak, you gain +1 AC while in woodland areas.  

You can utter a command word once per day to cause the leaves within the cloak to swirl around you, obscuring you and giving you the effect of the blur spell for 1 minute.

#### Blanket of Extreme Comfort
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This soft fur blanket makes whoever is touching it comfortably warm. Anyone in contact with this magic blanket can comfortably withstand any extreme temperature, whether extreme heat or cold.

#### Bottle O' Beess
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

Appears as a corked, dark colored glass bottle with raised words on the outside which read: "If you treat me nicely I will be sweet. If you treat me roughly, I will get mad."

This bottle of bees can be used to produce sweet delicious honey or to unleash a fury of bees on someone.

**Honey.**  If you uncork the bottle gently, it will pour out a stream of honey (about a pint) as an action.

**Bee Swarm.**  If shaken before opening, the bottle produces an angry swarm of bees with the statistics of a a swarm of wasps pours out and occupies a space within 5 feet of you. The bees are friendly to you and your companions for 1 minute. Roll initiative for the swarm, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the swarm, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. The bees disappear when the swarm is reduced to 0 hit points or when the duration ends.

Once you use one of the bottle's powers, you can't use it again until the next dawn.

If the bottle is broken, the swarm turns on the person who was holding the item before it broke.

#### Firewaver Gloves
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While wearing these fine golden gloves, you can hold and carry small nonmagical flames (such as that of a torch or candle) as if they were tangible objects and can sculpt them like clay. Once sculpted, a flame retains its form for 1 minute before returning to normal. A nonmagical flame carried in this way burns brightly for 1 hour before dying. If you drop or throw the carried flame, it immediately burns out.

These gloves have 1 charge that recharges each day at dawn. While wearing the gloves, you can expend 1 charge to cast the continual flame spell without material components, creating the flame in the palm of your hand or allowing it to encompass an entire glove. The flame dies after 1 minute of not being in contact with the glove. In addition, when you take fire damage from a magical source, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by 1d8 + 2, provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you regain 1 charge.

## Rare Magical Items

#### Wooden Chain of the Unbroken Circle
*Armor (chain shirt), rare (requires attunement by a druid or ranger)*

This magical chain shirt is crafted using strange wooden links enchanted by a militant circle of druids. The wooden chain is reinforced with old, natural magic that responds to the wearer's reverent connection to nature. While wearing this armor, you gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Wisdom modifier (max 2) in addition to the armor's normal AC.

#### Ring of Earthly Movement
*Ring, rare (requires attunement)*

While attuned to this bulky thumb ring made of polished granite, you have a burrowing speed equal to your walking speed.  You can glide through natural, unworked stone, dirt, and other soft earth.  Your burrowing leaves no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of your presence.  You can only be detected by the detect magic spell or similar magic.

#### Fire Wand of the Unbroken Circle
*Wand, rare (requires attunement by a druid)*

This wooden wand is carved out of ash and is always faintly warm to the touch. Whenever you grip the wand's handle and later look at your palm, it's strangely covered in a fine layer of charcoal. This wand has 7 charges. While holding the wand, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast either the flame blade spell (2 charges) or produce flame cantrip (no charges, or 1 charge to cast at 5th level) using the wand with a spell attack bonus of +5. When you cast the flame blade spell using this wand, the sword's fiery blade appears above the wand's haft instead of in a free hand.

Whenever you would fail a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a flame blade spell cast from the wand, you can expend 1 charge as a reaction in order to succeed on the saving throw instead. You can only use your reaction in this way if you’re holding the wand.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand bursts into flame and is destroyed before crumbling into ashes.

#### Mirrorlight Edge
*Weapon (scimitar), rare*

This roughly hewn crystalline sword bends light in unexpected and dangerous ways. As an action, you can command the scimitar to emit up to 2 ghostly projections of itself. The sword can have up to 2 of these projections at any time, which last until dismissed (no action required). When you make a melee attack with this weapon, the projections become razor-sharp. Targets hit by the sword take an extra 1d4 slashing damage for each projection the sword has.

When swung, the distorted light and projections make the sword difficult to see. When you miss with a melee attack using the sword while it has at least 1 projection, you can choose to reroll the attack using 1 of the projections. You must use the new roll. After the attack, the projection fades.

The sword emits dim light in a 5-foot radius while it has 1 projection and 10 feet while it has 2. Sheathing the scimitar contains the projections' light without dismissing them.

#### Spiderbite Daggers
*Weapon (dagger), rare*

These daggers are made using the harvested fangs of a large venomous spider. When you hit the same target on your turn with each dagger, that target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take an extra 2d4 poison damage and become poisoned until the end of its next turn.

#### Daggerbird Cloak
*Wondrous item, rare (requries attunement)*

A cloak with a collar of slate-gray feathers that turn into sharp magical projectiles when removed. The wearer may pull up to 8 feathers per day. Feathers are destroyed after one use, and the cloak regrows 1d8+1 feathers each morning.

The feathers have the same statistics as a Dagger, +1 when thrown.

#### Festerwood Vizard
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

This dark wooden mask is strangely insect-like and magically conforms to fit the face of the creature that attunes to it. While wearing the mask, you gain blindsight out to a range of 10 feet. You can wear and remove the mask using an action.

In addition, you can summon a swarm of insects (beetles) that fly out of the mask’s mouth and obey your verbal commands as an action. You can command the swarm to move and make an attack as part of the action to summon them and then again on your following turns as a bonus action. If the swarm goes 10 minutes without attacking a creature, they dissipate harmlessly to seek food elsewhere. Once this property of the mask has been used, it can't be used again until the following dusk.

#### Giving Glove
*Glove, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

A single ornate, white glove covered in ancient writings and designs. The fabric of the glove appears almost translucent, but not the design. When this glove is worn (and attuned to the wearer) the fabric seems to dissolve into the wearer's skin leaving behind ornate patterns that look like tattoos. 

The glove has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. While you wear this glove, you can expend a number of charges to have a spell with a range of Self have a range of Touch instead.

| Cantrip | 1 |
| 1st-Level | 1 |
| 2nd-Level | 2 |
| 3rd-Level | 3 |
