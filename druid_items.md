## Common Magical Items

**Dryadleaf**  
*Wondrous Item, common*  

This magical plant only grows at the base of trees that are often stepped through by a dryad. Its leaves slowly shift as if brushed by a breeze. Touching the plant, even gently, causes its leaves to stop their gentle swaying for 1 minute. These plants are frequently cultivated by druids to train younger members of their circle to listen with more than just their ears.

Dryadleaf plants only grow up to 4 leaves at a time and are found in the wild with 1d4 matured leaves. Leaves are fully matured once they have a light green edge along their rim. A creature can eat 1 of the plant's fully grown leaves as an action. Once it does, that creature can speak to beasts and plants for 1 minute as if they shared a language. Once picked, a leaf retains this property for 7 days.

A creature can repot the plant following a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check. On a failure, the delicate plant is irreversibly damaged and dies. Once repotted, the plant can survive with surprisingly little air, allowing it to survive in an extradimensional space such as a bag of holding or portable hole. So long as it's watered lightly each day and given a moderate amount of sunlight (weather and environment permitting), the plant grows 1d4 missing leaves every 7 days.

**Shapeshifter's Circlet**  
*Wondrous item, common*  

This ivory circlet allows you to recreate some of the natural features of other creatures.  While wearing the circlet, you can spend 1 minute to gently massage your ears, forehead, or temples.  When you do, you can choose to create one of the following features or effects:
• You can cover or replace your own ears with the form of another creature's.
• You can summon one or more horns or antlers atop your head.
• You can change the appearance of your eyes, including their color and pupil shape.

You can only have 1 of these effects active at a time.  The effects last until you dismiss it as a bonus action, remove the circlet, or fall unconscious.  You don't gain any of the senses or abilities of another creature by recreating its physical features in this way.

**Uorik the Conqueror's Juice Cap**  
*Wondrous item, common*  

This friendly copper cup changes the flavor of water that's poured into it. As a bonus action, you can whisper the name of a fruit into the mouth of the cup. If the cup is filled with water, its color and flavor change to resemble the kind of juice the fruit makes when juiced. Uttering the name of another fruit into the cup changes its flavor and color again. Regardless of its appearance and flavor, the water is still only water. Shouting into the cup instead causes the juice to effervesce and bubble. If the water is poisoned, the drink tastes foul and badly fermented.
