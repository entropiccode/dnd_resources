## Common Magical Items

#### Dryadleaf
*Wondrous Item, common*  

This magical plant only grows at the base of trees that are often stepped through by a dryad. Its leaves slowly shift as if brushed by a breeze. Touching the plant, even gently, causes its leaves to stop their gentle swaying for 1 minute. These plants are frequently cultivated by druids to train younger members of their circle to listen with more than just their ears.

Dryadleaf plants only grow up to 4 leaves at a time and are found in the wild with 1d4 matured leaves. Leaves are fully matured once they have a light green edge along their rim. A creature can eat 1 of the plant's fully grown leaves as an action. Once it does, that creature can speak to beasts and plants for 1 minute as if they shared a language. Once picked, a leaf retains this property for 7 days.

A creature can repot the plant following a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check. On a failure, the delicate plant is irreversibly damaged and dies. Once repotted, the plant can survive with surprisingly little air, allowing it to survive in an extradimensional space such as a bag of holding or portable hole. So long as it's watered lightly each day and given a moderate amount of sunlight (weather and environment permitting), the plant grows 1d4 missing leaves every 7 days.

#### Shapeshifter's Circlet
*Wondrous item, common*  

This ivory circlet allows you to recreate some of the natural features of other creatures.  While wearing the circlet, you can spend 1 minute to gently massage your ears, forehead, or temples.  When you do, you can choose to create one of the following features or effects:
• You can cover or replace your own ears with the form of another creature's.
• You can summon one or more horns or antlers atop your head.
• You can change the appearance of your eyes, including their color and pupil shape.

You can only have 1 of these effects active at a time.  The effects last until you dismiss it as a bonus action, remove the circlet, or fall unconscious.  You don't gain any of the senses or abilities of another creature by recreating its physical features in this way.

#### Uorik the Conqueror's Juice Cap
*Wondrous item, common*  

This friendly copper cup changes the flavor of water that's poured into it. As a bonus action, you can whisper the name of a fruit into the mouth of the cup. If the cup is filled with water, its color and flavor change to resemble the kind of juice the fruit makes when juiced. Uttering the name of another fruit into the cup changes its flavor and color again. Regardless of its appearance and flavor, the water is still only water. Shouting into the cup instead causes the juice to effervesce and bubble. If the water is poisoned, the drink tastes foul and badly fermented.

## Uncommon Magical Items

#### Ironleaf Oaken Shield
*Armor (shield), uncommon (requires attunement by a druid)*  

This reinforced wooden shield is covered with ironleaf vines that grant you extra protection.  You gain a +1 bonus to your AC while wielding this shield in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.  In addition, the wooden shield reforms itself to fit you whenever you use your wild shape class feature to transform into a beast.  When you do, the ironleaf vines and wooden shield latch onto your bestial form, granting you a +1 bonus to your AC while transformed in this way.

*Potion, uncommon*

When you drink this potion, you must roll a d20.

The effects of this potion last 10 minutes.

#### Autumn Cloak
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

#### Bottle O' Beess
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

Appears as a corked, dark colored glass bottle with raised words on the outside which read: "If you treat me nicely I will be sweet. If you treat me roughly, I will get mad."

This bottle of bees can be used to produce sweet delicious honey or to unleash a fury of bees on someone.

**Honey.**  If you uncork the bottle gently, it will pour out a stream of honey (about a pint) as an action.

**Bee Swarm.**  If shaken before opening, the bottle produces an angry swarm of bees with the statistics of a a swarm of wasps pours out and occupies a space within 5 feet of you. The bees are friendly to you and your companions for 1 minute. Roll initiative for the swarm, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the swarm, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. The bees disappear when the swarm is reduced to 0 hit points or when the duration ends.

Once you use one of the bottle's powers, you can't use it again until the next dawn.

If the bottle is broken, the swarm turns on the person who was holding the item before it broke.

#### Firewaver Gloves
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While wearing these fine golden gloves, you can hold and carry small nonmagical flames (such as that of a torch or candle) as if they were tangible objects and can sculpt them like clay. Once sculpted, a flame retains its form for 1 minute before returning to normal. A nonmagical flame carried in this way burns brightly for 1 hour before dying. If you drop or throw the carried flame, it immediately burns out.

These gloves have 1 charge that recharges each day at dawn. While wearing the gloves, you can expend 1 charge to cast the continual flame spell without material components, creating the flame in the palm of your hand or allowing it to encompass an entire glove. The flame dies after 1 minute of not being in contact with the glove. In addition, when you take fire damage from a magical source, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by 1d8 + 2, provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you regain 1 charge.

## Rare Magical Items

#### Wooden Chain of the Unbroken Circle
*Armor (chain shirt), rare (requires attunement by a druid or ranger)*

This magical chain shirt is crafted using strange wooden links enchanted by a militant circle of druids. The wooden chain is reinforced with old, natural magic that responds to the wearer's reverent connection to nature.

#### Ring of Earthly Movement
*Ring, rare (requires attunement)*

While attuned to this bulky thumb ring made of polished granite, you have a burrowing speed equal to your walking speed.  You can glide through natural, unworked stone, dirt, and other soft earth.  Your burrowing leaves no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of your presence.  You can only be detected by the detect magic spell or similar magic.

---

#### Fire Wand of the Unbroken Circle
*Wand, rare (requires attunement by a druid)*

This wooden wand is carved out of ash and is always faintly warm to the touch. Whenever you grip the wand's handle and later look at your palm, it's strangely covered in a fine layer of charcoal. This wand has 7 charges. While holding the wand, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast either the flame blade spell (2 charges) or produce flame cantrip (no charges, or 1 charge to cast at 5th level) using the wand with a spell attack bonus of +5. When you cast the flame blade spell using this wand, the sword's fiery blade appears above the wand's haft instead of in a free hand.

Whenever you would fail a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a flame blade spell cast from the wand, you can expend 1 charge as a reaction in order to succeed on the saving throw instead. You can only use your reaction in this way if you’re holding the wand.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand bursts into flame and is destroyed before crumbling into ashes.

#### Mirrorlight Edge
*Weapon (scimitar), rare*

This roughly hewn crystalline sword bends light in unexpected and dangerous ways. As an action, you can command the scimitar to emit up to 2 ghostly projections of itself. The sword can have up to 2 of these projections at any time, which last until dismissed (no action required). When you make a melee attack with this weapon, the projections become razor-sharp. Targets hit by the sword take an extra 1d4 slashing damage for each projection the sword has.

When swung, the distorted light and projections make the sword difficult to see. When you miss with a melee attack using the sword while it has at least 1 projection, you can choose to reroll the attack using 1 of the projections. You must use the new roll. After the attack, the projection fades.

The sword emits dim light in a 5-foot radius while it has 1 projection and 10 feet while it has 2. Sheathing the scimitar contains the projections' light without dismissing them.

---

#### Spiderbite Daggers
*Weapon (dagger), rare*

These daggers are made using the harvested fangs of a large venomous spider. When you hit the same target on your turn with each dagger, that target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take an extra 2d4 poison damage and become poisoned until the end of its next turn.

---

#### Daggerbird Cloak
*Wondrous item, rare (requries attunement)*

A cloak with a collar of slate-gray feathers that turn into sharp magical projectiles when removed. The wearer may pull up to 8 feathers per day. Feathers are destroyed after one use, and the cloak regrows 1d8+1 feathers each morning.

The feathers have the same statistics as a Dagger, +1 when thrown.

---

#### Festerwood Vizard
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

This dark wooden mask is strangely insect-like and magically conforms to fit the face of the creature that attunes to it. While wearing the mask, you gain blindsight out to a range of 10 feet. You can wear and remove the mask using an action.

In addition, you can summon a swarm of insects (beetles) that fly out of the mask’s mouth and obey your verbal commands as an action. You can command the swarm to move and make an attack as part of the action to summon them and then again on your following turns as a bonus action. If the swarm goes 10 minutes without attacking a creature, they dissipate harmlessly to seek food elsewhere. Once this property of the mask has been used, it can't be used again until the following dusk.

---

#### Giving Glove
*Glove, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

A single ornate, white glove covered in ancient writings and designs. The fabric of the glove appears almost translucent, but not the design.

#### Dreamwood Staff
*Staff, very rare (requires attunement)*

While you are attuned to this grey wooden staff, the saving throw DC for your enchantment spells increases by 2, and the targets of your enchantment spells make their saving throws at disadvantage.

----

#### Festerwood Fungal Stave
*Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or sorcerer)*

This fungal staff has 25 charges and regains 1d10+15 expended charges each day at dusk. While holding the staff, you can expend 1 or more charges as an action to cause clusters of noxious mushrooms to magically appear in a number of unoccupied spaces equal to the number of charges you expend. The spaces must be on solid ground and within 60 feet of you. Each space becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within an space or area with these mushrooms, it takes 2d4 poison damage for every 5 feet it travels. The mushrooms live for 1 minute or until you dismiss them early (no action required).

In addition, while holding the staff, you can expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: cloudkill (5 charges), fog cloud (1 charge), insect plague (5 charges), or stinking cloud (3 charges). These spells are cast using a bonus action instead of their normal casting time and must target a point adjacent to a space occupied by the mushrooms. In addition, these spells' duration becomes 1 round instead of their normal duration, ending at the end of your next turn, and do not require concentration.

If you expend the last charge from the staff, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff begins to violently overgrow, forcing you to drop it in an unoccupied space adjacent to you. If the staff is dropped on solid ground, a violet fungus (Monster Manual p. 138) grows in its place.

#### Staff of the Four Seasons
*Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a nature cleric, druid, oath of the ancients paladin, warlock, wizard, or sorcerer)*

This magical staff changes with the seasons. You can spend 10 minutes concentrating on the staff to change it to a different season. It remains in this new form for the next 8 hours before reverting to the current season again.

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. In addition, your melee attacks with the staff deal an extra 1d8 cold (Winter), radiant (Spring), fire (Summer), or necrotic (Autumn) damage based on its season as long as there is at least 1 charge remaining on the staff.

This staff has 10 charges. While holding the staff, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (depending on its season) using your spell attack modifier and spell save DC:

#### Grass Whistle Blade
*Weapon (dagger), very rare (requires attunement)*

This dagger's blade is actually a large, enchanted blade of grass. As wind passes over the blade, it creates a soft, sweet note that magically begins to lull creatures to sleep. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

This blade has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges each day at dawn. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using this dagger, you can choose to expend 1 charge and forgo the attack's damage to attempt to put the creature to sleep. When you do, you swing the blade in a pattern around the creature that creates a magical lullaby. Roll 10d8; the total is how many hit points of the creature this can affect. If the total number of hit points you roll is greater than the target's remaining hit points, that creature falls unconscious for 1 minute or until it takes damage or another creature uses an action to shake or slap that creature awake. If the target is not put to sleep, it takes 3d8 psychic damage instead.

Undead and creatures immune to being charmed can't be put to sleep by this effect.

#### Stalaga Spear
*Weapon (spear), very rare (requires attunement)*

This magic spear is made of dark, polished granite and has a large ruby set in its head. While made of stone, it weighs no more than a normal spear and is enchanted to prevent it from shattering. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

This spear has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges each day at dawn. While standing on or next to unworked stone or earth, you can expend 1 charge as an action to plunge the spear into the stone or earth. The spear vanishes into the surface and emerges as a sharp stone spike that's 1 foot wide and 10 foot long from another surface made of unworked stone or earth that you can see within 60 feet of you, such as the ground or a cave wall. The spike erupts from the surface and forces any creature within a line 5 feet wide and 10 feet long to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 piercing damage and is pushed up to 5 feet away from the spike. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and is not pushed.

While you're within 60 feet of the stone spike and standing on or next to unworked stone or earth, you can use a bonus action to speak the spear's command word to recall it. The stone spike crumbles and the spear inside vanishes back into the surface it came from before reemerging from the surface next to you into your open hand. If you don't have an open hand, it falls to the ground at your feet.

This property is suppressed while you are incapacitated, restrained, or otherwise unable to move.

In addition, you can cast the dream spell (save DC 16) using the mantle, using yourself as the messenger within the dream. Once this property of the mantle has been used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.

---
